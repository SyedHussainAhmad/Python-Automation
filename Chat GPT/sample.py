SEO Rachel is a baker who runs her own
What is SEO?
Bakery to expand her business she decided to create an online presence by first
setting up a Blog she began posting on her blog regularly however even after
regularly posting on the blog there were barely any visitors showing up deciding
not to give up Rachel began searching for a solution on the internet that's when she came across SEO or search
engine optimization a term she's never heard before so let's take a journey together and
help her learn about SEO search engine optimization is a method that could improve the quality and quantity of the
audience coming to Rachel's website from search engines it could increase brand awareness attract local customers and
build credibility and trust and all of this is possible without having to spend
a single penny to bring visitors to our website Rachel would have to take advantage of the two types of SEO
on-page and off-page SEO Rachel first decides to tackle on-page SEO and get
that sorted on-page SEO involved Rachel optimizing her website both in terms of
content and the technical aspects including the HTML source code schema meta Tags and More she started off by
using tools like Google AdWords allref and semrush to identify popular Search terms associated with the recipes she
planned to publish on her blog she began to look for Search terms related to the broader area of baking cooking and
related topics once she found these Search terms she began to incorporate them into her recipes
she started off by providing an introduction to the recipe with this she could provide an engaging beginning to
her story like how the dish reminded her of her childhood and enabled her to
naturally include the Search terms into the blog she also included these keywords in the actual recipe as well
additionally she added pictures videos time lapses and more to increase
credibility and engagement for her content and subsequently persuading search engines to show her content to
more people after this she moved to the website metacontent that search engines display when her blog appears in search
results she optimized The Meta tax alt tags header Tags and More this completed the
on-page aspect of SEO thanks to this she saw a significant increase in the number of visitors coming to her page having
done all she could on her webpage she now decides to explore what could be done off page to improve her Page's
visibility on search engines off-page SEO involved Rachel doing things outside her site page to help increase its
search engine rankings making optimizations outside the site would improve the site's popularity relevance
trustworthiness and Authority this is possible with the help of reputable websites vouching for your content with
backlinks social media marketing guest blogging linked unlinked brand mentions
influencer marketing and much more Rachel also understood that for her
content to reach people she would have to promote it on social media platforms like Facebook Twitter and Instagram as
well as Niche platforms like quora Reddit and medium these could help her achieve greater reach for her website by
sending stronger social signals to search engines leading to the page being shown as
highly relevant for related searches and audiences and even after understanding
and implementing all of this Rachel had just scratched the surface of what was possible with SEO
before we find out what she did next let's have a look at a quiz which of the following is the most effective way to
improve off-page SEO one creating plenty of web pages of a Content 2. getting
backlinks from relevant and authoritative sites three acquiring backlinks through link Buy
4. none of the above let us know your answer in the comments section below for
a chance to win an Amazon voucher now let's go back to Rachel Rachel decided
to take up simplylearn's digital marketing certification with classes covering just about everything she
needed to know about SEO it was only a matter of time before Rachel began to implement her learnings on her website
and see a massive uptick in the number of viewers coming to her website in time
she could even earn money off the site by setting up an online shop and with that we've covered an introduction to
the concepts of SEO and the possibilities it can open for you either as a marketer or a business owner so
we're going to use a basic example and let's just say you have a Blog you're a food blogger you're passionate about
Why SEO is Important?
food and your Niche is ice cream and let's just say you have a lot of ice cream recipes you want to get traffic to
your blog you want people to read your blog and you're curious why am I not ranking for my blog why when people type
in ice cream recipes and say Google my blog posts don't appear at the top of
organic rankings and there's a number of reasons why you wouldn't be ranked for
your blog post or your ice cream recipes and the main reason would be your competitors so there could be somebody
else out there who is also passionate about ice cream and has been blogging along longer than you and they have more
content and more blog posts and more pages for Google to rank so that's
usually the number one reason the other reason is improper usage of keywords and we're going to talk a little bit or it's
actually a lot more about you know keyword usage in your content so what
kind of keywords do you want to rank for that's really what we're talking about when we talk about usage of keywords
what keywords do you want to rank for and how do we work those keywords into the content another reason is poor link
building practices and really that means our other blog posts or other websites
linking to you also are you linking to other pages on your website and so it's all about link building and with link
building it's internal linking so are we linking from one blog post to another and it's external linking our other
websites of high quality linking to us and so that's what we talk about when we talk about link building and then
another reason is web page load time so you could be running your blog post on
say WordPress for example and your blog post isn't loading fast enough well if
you look at it this way think about it if you're Google would you really want to rank a website or blog post in this
example number one on Google rankings if that particular page loaded very slow no
you wouldn't because when somebody clicked on that link in organic search and went to your website they're going
to have a bad experience because the page is going to load slow so Google doesn't want their users to have a bad
experience you don't want your users to have a bad experience and so that's why web page load time is a critical factor
for ranking so we need to make sure that our web pages load fast and then your
user experience is not good enough so Google again based on my example about the web page load time Google wants
people to have a good experience when they go from their search engine to your website and there's a lot at play there
specifically web page load time but also you know Google doesn't want any spam
content Google doesn't want any pop-ups or overbearing ads on the web page they
want people to are searching for something in particular let's just say ice cream recipes and they want to find
a relevant website that has ice cream recipes they want to be able to click on that link and read some good content
about ice cream recipes it's that simple and that's really what Google's trying to create in their environment and
that's you as an end user as a website owner you want your users to have a good experience and then why last but not
least your website is the indexed by mistake and really what we mean is the indexed is Google needs to be able to
index all the pages on your website so if you have a Blog with a hundred recipes you want Google to have access
to all 100 recipes so we're going to talk a little bit later about how to get
your pages ranked or indexed on Google organic search so let's move on to what
is SEO so sticking with our ice cream Blog theme really SEO search engine
optimization really is the practice of increasing your pages that Google has
indexed up the rankings so the end result is we want all our pages to be ranked number one for particular
keywords so if you want to be ranked for ice cream recipes well there's certain things you need to do so that's
generally how it works we need to apply search engine optimization to increase a
page for keyword we want to be found for so let me give you an example so let's
just say there's a hundred students that participated in an essay competition and so the competition in this particular
case is evaluated on the basis of is the content relevant are they using suitable
titles for their essay do they have structure when they're participating in this essay or talking about the essay
and do they have a suitable synopsis and is the content neat and readable these seem all logical for an essay
competition well guess what they seem logical for SEO because that's exactly how SEO works it's exactly all those
points I just made mentioned about structure logic readability organization
title all those things are what's important in SEO and so we need relevant
content we need titles for our Pages Google needs to be able to see structure
we need to have synopsis of what the page is about and that's called The Meta description and then again the the
content needs to be readable and that's important and so in order to be readable again we're going to talk more about
site speed because site speed is important okay and when we talk about responsive design when I say respond to
design that means your site your page needs a load both on desktop and also on
mobile and so all these things are important just like an essay competition Google is the judge and they need to be
able to determine what page is best to rank number one number two number three
Etc on Google Search and then link building remember I mentioned link building a moment ago well link building
internally and externally also plays a vital role and so we're going to talk about that a little bit later in the
class when we talk about off-page SEO how does Google rank website and basically Google follows three basic
steps to rank a website they need to crawl your website they need to take what they crawl back to their servers
and when they take it back to their servers your web pages they need to you
know have them available for indexing so when somebody actually types in a keyword into google.com it'll be
available to be found on organic search so that's what indexing is all about and then Google's job when somebody does
type in a search query is to basically rank those pages that they've indexed
from number one to Infinity depending on how many pages are relevant to that search query so really it's about
crawling indexing and ranking so crawling is simply a process done by
which Google has Bots and what these Bots do is they go to your web server
and they're going to crawl every page that they can find and how do they find
these Pages well they basically follow links you might have heard the term spidering but that's what they call search engine spidering so basically
what Google's doing is they're building a web so to speak all the links that they're following and so when they can
follow all these links on your website they're going to be able to crawl them and when they crawl them basically they
going to take that content and store it on their servers so it's available in their index So based on this method
Google finds out which websites have relevant content and which ones don't based on certain keywords that are typed
into Google because if they can't crawl your website you're not going to be found and if you can't be found then you're not going to show up for Relevant
keywords so we need to make sure your site's available to be crawled and we'll talk about that a little bit later okay
but let's show you an example so let's just go to Google Search and if I type
in the keyword simply learn okay I could see I have one way in 10 000 results
okay and that's how many results are showing up for simply learn okay now they may not all be simply learn pages
but nonetheless simply learned is ranked number one here organically and there
are 1 million 10 000 Pages related to the keyword simply learn now when it
comes to organic search we don't want to get it confused with paid search so anytime time you see paid search you're
going to see something that says add next to it okay so we could see that there are paid ads here but when it
comes to organic search those are generally below paid ads and so that's where Google counts the 1 million 10 000
results and so that's the whole idea behind crawling and indexing Google's
able to cross simply learns website and based on all the pages that they gather they're going to make those pages
available in organic search so if you type in a keyword and your web page is
not available for indexing then you're never going to show up for that keyword so that's why it's important to make
sure your website is available for crawling and indexing and so when a user
types a query on search Google search the most relevant websites that are in
Google's index are going to pair in the search results so in the example I gave was simply learn well simply learn is
the brand name of the company simply learned so there's a a lot of relevancy there so that's why you see simply learn
show up here organically number one like we mentioned about what is SEO and why
SEO we talked about that user experience so there's a lot of factors that go into
ranking relevancy being one of them so in the simply learned example simply
learn is relevant to a lot of the simply learned Pages because that's who they are simply learn however simply learn
also needs to make sure that you know for their Pages the page load time is fast meaning these Pages load very fast
for the end user and Google also takes into account other factors like how long
someone is staying on a website or are they bouncing meaning are they going to one page that they land on and then
leaving the website okay and so the user experience is very very important there
are other factors also like language and location and so for example location if
you do a search say in India the results are going to be a little bit different than say the results in the United
States why because Google is indexing as many web pages as they can find so if
somebody's doing a search in India their results may be a little bit different than the results show up in the U.S
because Google has different Bots and these Bots are crawling different pages
at different times and so Google's index is updating continuously but it's not
real time syncing so if you do a search in India you may not see exactly the same thing because both search engines
the Google in India and the Google and the US are may not be exactly synced up
so an example would be you know if you're looking for Cafe so if you search
a cafe in say San Francisco you're going to see different results now if you do a
search for cafes in Mumbai you're going to see different results there's going to be local search here at the top there
may be some paid search but again you may see different results because one
location but two Google search engines in India and United States google.com
aren't exactly synced up exactly at the same exact time you do that search so
location is important language is important and relevancy is important
along with user experience so all those are important factors in how Google
ranks websites okay so we're going to talk about the types of SEO now so if we
want to rank for a particular keyword on Google we're going to have to apply
search engine optimization and so there's two strategies to search engine optimization on-page SEO and off-page
SEO so first we're going to talk about on-page SEO so on page SEO is nothing
Overview of Types of SEO
more than optimizing your own website and so when we say optimizing your own
website there's certain elements on your website and on your web pages that we need to take into account and so some of
those elements are headers meta descriptions title tags linking so all
of those elements are something we can control as an end user who wants to rank
our web page and our website on Google and before we do anything with our
website the first thing we need to do is understand what keywords we want to rank
for in order to understand what keywords we want to rank for we need to do keyword research and if you do anything
in SEO keyword research is the most important activity that's the most
important thing you can do for SEO and why do I say it's the most important because you need to understand if you
choose a keyword that you want to rank for you need to understand how much traffic you're going to get from that
keyword if you're ranked organically say number one on Google so how much traffic
will you get if you're ranked number one on Google so you need to understand what the volume is and the number 2 we need
to understand what the competition is for that keyword that you want to rank for so if you choose a keyword and
there's not much competition for it then chances are you can rank for that keyword for a web page on your website
quicker than say a keyword that has a lot of competition so we need to understand those two basic factors
volume and competition before we choose a keyword and it's it's simply the practice of going through the motions of
getting your volume and getting your competition data so you can choose the keywords you want and then once you
choose the keyword you want then you can go and apply on page SEO you can change
the title tag The Meta descriptions the headers all those elements can be changed but first you need to choose
your keywords and so again the primary components we're looking for are how
much traffic you can get or the search volume how much competition there is for that keyword and of course relevancy
okay you need to be able to choose a key keyword that's relevant to the web page you're trying to rank for and so let me
show you example how to go through this so the first thing we want to do is we want to use a tool and the tool I would
recommend is Google Keyword Planner and why do I choose Google Keyword Planner because if we're trying to rank on
google.com or Google search engine we want to be able to get the data right from the source so Google's going to be
able to give us information about how much volume a keyword has and how much competition it has so let me show you an
example so if I want to use Google's Keyword Planner and I want to rank for
the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist then I'm going to type that keyword into Google's Keyword
Planner and what Google's going to do is they're going to give me some Trends about how much volume this particular
keyword gets over the course of a year and so for that particular keyword I can
see that there are trends that that appear for both desktop and mobile so
mobile is important because people start their search process a lot of times on
their mobile device so we want to be able to get data from mobile as well as desktop and so we could see a trend here
that for each particular month over the last 12 months we can see how much
volume this particular keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist gets per month and so on average on
average over the past 12 months I could see how to become a digital marketing specialist is averages 30 searches a
month and this is on google.com and so Google gives us the volume what they also give us is the competition and so
here I can see Google says for that particular keyword the competition is medium and so in the Google's Keyword
Planner what they also do is give me other relevant keywords that I might think about optimizing for because you
don't want to optimize for just one key word so how to become a digital marketing specialist they're going to
also offer up other types of keywords that are relevant so just digital marketing Specialists social media
marketing specialist so for those keywords I can see the volume so for example digital marketing specialist I
can see the average volume is one thousand per month on average of the last 12 months I can also see the
competition is medium but for some other keywords I can see the search volume being high like digital marketing course
at 2900 per month but also the competition is high and so what I would recommend is a best practice is to
collect all your relevant keywords okay and put all your relevant keywords in a
spreadsheet and when you put all these relevant keywords in a spreadsheet you want to get the data on those keywords
and the data I'm referring to is the volume and competition so in this case we have volume from Google planner
Google's Keyword Planner and I have competition from Google's Keyword Planner and so if I go into a spread
shade and I put all that information in here I'm going to be able to see the volume and competition and so that's
important however one thing to note here is that Google's Keyword Planner if I go back just gives us low medium and high
and if I want to compare numbers to numbers maybe I want to be able to get
exactly the competition number for the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist what I can do is go
into Google and I can type in that keyword so if I type in the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist
I can see there's 76 Million results so I could see 76 Million results 76.1
actually and for the keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist now that's a whole lot of results for
this particular keyword especially when the volume is only 30 per month on
average and so what I want to do is get a more clear picture of the competition
and so what you can could actually do is type in the syntax all in title and then
colon and then your keyword how to become a digital marketing specialist and when I do that I get a different
result here I can see only 136 listings for how to become a digital
marketing specialist but that's not just 136 that's 136 with that particular
keyword that we want to rank for in the title tag okay so the title tag is what
you see when you type in a keyword or search query in Google search and the
title tag is what you see at the top of every search result and so now I can see
I typed in how to become a digital marketing specialist with the all entitled syntax and now I can see every
listing every one of these 136 results have that particular keyword in it so I
could see every one of them how to become a digital marketing specialist and why is that important because now
that tells me I only need to climb over 136 listings to rank for that keyword
how to become a digital marketing specialist and so the idea here is you
want to get your volume from Google's Keyword Planner but you want to get your competition from Google search and again
that's simply typing in the syntax all in title and then your keyword in this
example how to become a digital marketing specialist once you get those two numbers you're going to plug them in
to your spreadsheet and then once you do that for number of different keyword queries and these keyword queries again
have to be relevant once you do that then you can go in and pick the keywords
you want to optimize for and that's important because again if you're not sure about a keyword then you want to do
the keyword research so you can be sure of how much traffic you can get and how
much competition there is those are two important three important factors in starting the process for on-page SEO so
again you want to create content for say a keyword like
digital marketing but digital marketing may seem a little bit broad so you want to probably stay
away from broader keywords because broader keywords tend to have a lot of volume which is great but they may also
tend to have a lot of competition but that's the whole point of doing the keyword research maybe it doesn't maybe
there's more volume than competition that's what you need to find out when you do the keyword research you need to
find those keywords that are relevant to your content that have a lot of volume and low competition and then once we
identify those keywords then we are free to go in and start optimizing our web
pages for those keywords and the first place we want to start is the title tag so if you remember my example going back
here to our search how to become a digital marketing specialist we saw that every one of these listings had that
keyword in the title tag and the title tag is important because that's what users who use Google search see first
when they talk type in a query and get results so they're going to see the title tag so the title tag is the most
important element for on-page SEO it's the most important factor because that's
what people see and so ideally when we choose our keyword we want to make sure that keyword is in the title tag because
that's what shows up in Google search and that's what makes that particular web page relevant for that keyword query
so the idea behind a title tag it's between 50 and 60 characters and so we
want to make sure we stay within that limit no more than 60 characters because
what happens if it's beyond that then Google will truncate the title tag so if I go back to my search you can see here
on this particular title tag Google trunk handed it meaning they added the ellipses after the title tag because it
exceeded the 60 character limit so you want to stay within those character counts and so the title tag is the first
place you should start when optimizing your website because we have the right keyword in the title tag and somebody
types in that keyword then chances are it's going to be relevant they're going to see it and they're going to click
through to your website and that's the whole idea behind ranking we want to get clicks so that's how the title tag
appears so when you optimize it you're going to update the title tag and this is how it shows up it's going to show up
at the top of your listing okay and it's going to be bigger and Bolder than anything else Google displays so the
second thing you want to optimize is the meta description and The Meta description is simply just a brief
description up to 155 I would say about 155 to 60 160 characters but probably no
more than that and so the meta description is nothing more than a summary of the web page itself so if I
go back to my Google search results I see my title tag and I see the page that
this particular listing belongs to and underneath that is where I can see my
meta description so in this particular keyword query how to become a digital marketing specialist I see the meta
description an ultimate guide on how to build a career in digital marketing and the skills required to become a digital
marketing specialist note that it's a well-written meta description within 155
characters and it includes the keyword digital marketing specialist so we're trying to rank for how to become a
digital marketing specialist and here you can see become a digital marketing specialist so there's a lot of relevancy
between not only the title tag and the keyword but the meta description and the keyword so when you're optimizing a
keyword you want to start with the title tag but you also want to update the meta description because if you don't update
the meta description and you leave The Meta description blank then you're leaving it to Google to add in copy that
they deem relevant and so for on-page SEO we want to take control of the copy
and we want to optimize it for the keywords we want to be found for so the meta description is a powerful tool at
our disposal it gives us more characters to work with it gives us more to talk about so for that particular page and so
if the title tag is only 60 characters maximum it's not a lot of information to
try and get somebody to click so the meta description helps us in identifying what that page is about in order to get
the click so the two working in tandem will hopefully increase your click-through rates so when you're found
organically we want to get the click and then the third element that's important is the URL and URL stands for uniform
resource locator and why is the URL so important because that's what people see
so if I go back to my search result how to become a digital marketing specialist notice that the URL also includes how to
become a digital marketing specialist article okay so it's very relevant the URL is very relevant one we can see it
in the search results but two you know it's is relevant to the keyword query and that's important for the end user
and Google Google wants to know hey is this the page that's relevant to the
user's query and if it is then this user is likely going to have a good X user
experience after they click on the listing so the URL is an element that
helps not only with the click-through rate but with ranking and having a poor URL structure doesn't help at all
because not only does Google not recognize the URL as being relevant but the end user may not want to click on
that page given the the way the URL looks so you want to try and avoid a poor URL structure so the rule of thumb
is this if you don't understand what the URL is then Google is likely not going
to understand what the URL is and so we want to try and keep our URL structures clean and when I say clean ideally you
want to make sure that whatever keyword you're trying to optimize that's the key word that's in included in the URL
nothing included that is not understandable so again going back to
our example how to become a digital marketing specialist it's very clean the title tag is the keyword The Meta
description is cleanly written has the keyword and then the URL is the other element that the end user can see and
that URL includes the keyword in it so after we've done those three elements
the title tag The Meta description and the URL then we want to start optimizing
the page itself so ideally when we say optimize the page itself the page
remember needs to be structured and when we say structured it needs to be structured in terms of you know headers
and subheaders and organized in a manner in which the end user can read the
article read the content clearly and concisely without being confused and so
that's the job of headers they add they add basically an organization relational structure to the content and with
headers there's a hierarchy so you have anywhere from H1 which is the top of the hierarchy to an H6 and so you're free to
use any one of those headers when building on a page in order to organize the content but ideally you probably
want to stick with an H1 or an H2 because those are at the top of the hierarchy and what those do is they
actually stress to Google that hey this header with this particular keyword in
it is important so if you use an H6 with the keyword in it it's telling Google
hey this is an H6 but it's not as important so an H1 and an H2 tag show
importance and so let's look at an example of what that is so here you could see an H1 is going to be at the
top of the hierarchy so that means it's going to be bigger and Bolder then you have an H2 which is going to be bigger
and Bolder than an H3 but not as big and bold as an H2 so with headers not only
are you organizing the content 10 accordingly but you're also signaling to Google how important that particular
header is and of course the header needs to include the keyword we're trying to rank for so let's take a look again at
that example so if we go to how to become a digital marketing specialist if I click on that page I can look at the
content and I can see that there are headers in here so the headers are there
to organize the content and that's what we want we want to be able to organize the content and if you look at the other
example I'm showing here how to become a digital marketing specialist a learning path Explorer you can see that's an H1
but below it's a subheader the growing digital marketing job market so that's an H2 and so we're not stressing to
Google that that's more important than nh1 but nonetheless we're stressing at Google that it's important nonetheless
so we want to be able to use headers we want to be able to use keywords in our headers in order to stress to Google
what's important and also to organize the content because Google likes content
organized okay the next element we want to focus on is internal linking and so
internal link you never remember earlier in the presentation it's basically links
from one page on your website to another and so here we can see on this
particular article how to become a digital marketing specialist there's also links to other pages on simply
learns website and so for this particular content it also links to SEO
specialist PPC specialist social media marketing Specialists and digital marketing specialist so the whole idea
behind internal linking is to link from one page to another where it's relevant and in this case it's relevant because
we're talking about how to become a digital marketing specialist that's what the whole content is about and so what
simply learns doing here is offering up other pages on their web website that are relevant to becoming a digital
marketing specialist and so this is a best practice when you're optimizing a web page so you want to be able to have
internal linking on your site and the whole idea behind internal linking is it
also allows users to navigate through the site naturally so when I say naturally they don't always have to
refer back to the top navigation they can naturally and seamlessly go from one
relevant article or page to another and so that's the whole idea behind link building and internal link building it
allows Google to identify you know pages that they want to crawl and index
because they're linked to one another but it also helps the end user because it allows the end user to go from one
page to another and it's signaling to Google hey this particular page is linked to this page so we're going to
also index that page and so that's the whole important part of internal linking
it's about the end you user experience and it's about allowing Google to find
the pages on your website so they can crawl them and index them so you can be
ranked for them and so also in addition to internal linking we want to be able
to use natural language and so what do I mean by natural language or natural
language processing so what Google does is in terms of natural language processing they're looking for the
content and the keyword it needs to be relevant so when your website is about digital marketing you don't necessarily
want to rank or try to rank for the keyword digital marketing one it's too broad two there might be some
competition but three you're probably not going to write something as broad like digital marketing so ideally what
you want to do is you want to choose other relevant related keywords that's going to be more natural and so that's
what we mean on natural language processing we want to choose keywords that are more natural to the content
you're writing so instead of the key or digital marketing maybe we want to talk about the types of digital marketing or
digital marketing examples or what is a digital marketing strategy or how to become a digital marketing specialist so
those are all relevant keywords to digital marketing and more relevant to the content because if you try to rank
for the keyword digital marketing again it's probably going to be a little bit broad probably more competition and not
as relevant to your content and as a result probably not a good user experience so think about some other
keywords that you could optimize and rank for and that goes back to the keyword research that's why the keyword
research is so important because it allows us to identify other keywords and
the natural language process what keywords are more relevant for the content and then another element to
on-page SEO is the sitemap and so with a site map it's basically a list of all
the pages on your website and the whole idea of listing all the pages on your
website in one document is it helps both users and search engines understand the
structure of your website so there are two types of sitemaps one's an HTML sitemap and that's designed for humans
so if you have a website with a lot of content at the footer or the bottom of
your web page you probably want to have a link to sitemap so if somebody clicks
on that side map they're going to be able to see all the pages on your website structured in an organized
manner well an XML sitemap and XML is just a different format it's designed
for crawlers and so the whole idea remember is Google likes to crawl content when they crawl content they
bring it back to their servers and index it and so we want to be able to create a sitemap for Google or other search
engine crawlers and so XML is the format so let me show you example of how that
looks so if I go to simplylearn.com and simply type in say sitemap.xml just as
an example I'm going to get this particular page in this particular page displays two XML sitemaps so these site
maps are there for Google to go ahead and crawl and nothing more than a list
of all the pages on your website and so this is a quick and easy way for Google
to get a hold of all those pages so that they can index them and that's the whole idea behind SEO you want to be able to
have Google index all the content you want to be found for for the keyword you
want to be found for so it all starts with the sitemap so let's go from on-page SEO which in recap is basically
optimizing certain elements on your website so that you are relevant for a
particular keyword and that meant updating the title tag The Meta description the URL the headers choosing
the right keywords to put into the content having internal linking chain and also updating the sitemap well those
are elements that you can do on your website so we're going to switch gears and talk about a different strategy
off-page SEO because without on page or off page you can't have a page ranking
so the two work together so you can do as much as you want on on page but you still need off-page SEO and you could do
all the off-page SEO you want but you still need on page so both of these strategies have to be in full effect in
order for you to rank so let's now switch gears to off-page SEO and so
off-page SEO is simply the process of linking or promoting your website using
link building and so if you remember I talked about this earlier on there's two
types of links internal and external linking and so for on-page SEO we used
internal linking for off-page SEO we're going to talk about external linking and
external linking allows us to improve our website sites recognition or
relevancy or credibility and why do we want to improve our relevancy and credibility and trustworthiness and
Authority because we want Google to know that our web page is trustworthy it is
recognized by other websites and it is relevant for a particular keyword and so if we can do that using off-page SEO
methods then Google's going to rank our web page for the keyword we want to be found for so it's really off-page SEO is
synonymous with link building and there's plenty of opportunities to do link building it just comes down to
creating a strategy so again some of the benefits to off page well we talked
about you know being credible and trustworthiness and relevant we need to do that in order to rank but there's
some other benefits there so if we're have a link on another credible website
then it's likely going to increase the traffic to our own website it also creates high domain Authority and so
what I mean by high domain Authority is if we have basically links to other web
pages pointing back to us then basically our domain Authority is going to improve
and when our domain Authority improves other websites are going to want to link to us so the higher authoritative we are
for our website than other web pages are going to want to link to us and so the
more external linking we have the higher the domain Authority so it all starts with linking to other high domain
Authority websites so linking to a high domain Authority website for example
having a link on Wikipedia that points back to our web page creates high domain
Authority for us and it helps Drive traffic so some of the other benefits of off-page SEO are in credibility so if
we're linking from Wikipedia to our web page it does create credibility for us it also helps us increase our page rank
so remember that external linking helps build domain Authority helps build credibility
trustworthiness and it's going to in turn help us rank for that particular page and then certainly not last having
a good off-page SEO link building strategy increases our brand awareness because if we're on other high Authority
websites Wikipedia or say a social platform it's going to increase our
brand awareness and increasing our brand awareness increases our trustworthiness
and so if somebody is looking to say become a digital marketing specialist then likely instead of typing in digital
marketing specialist on Google they might type in our brand name in this case simply learn and so these are all
the benefits to off-page SEO so it's nothing more than having links on other
websites that are pointing back to ours and again there's lots of benefits its
drives helps Drive traffic and increases our Authority so those are things that we want to take advantage of when we
want want to rank and the key behind off-page SEO or link building is always
going to be content so from an on-page SEO perspective having quality content
allows that content to be optimized for Relevant keyword and ranked but also
from an off-page SEO strategy having high quality content allows us to have
other sites and it doesn't necessarily have to be a website it could be a social platform or it can be another
blogging platform or blogging website link back to ours why because the content is original it's natural it's
well structured it reads well and so that's the whole idea behind off page you can't have links on other websites
if you don't have quality content so one of the ideas behind off-page SEO is not
only do you want to create good content but you probably want to spend a lot of time or a bit of time on others websites
so remember the example I used earlier in this presentation about having an ice cream blog and ice cream recipes well it
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to say spend some time on other blogs related to desserts related to cakes related to
food in general related to vegetables or other items that people could link from
so the whole idea is understanding who else is out there who has relevant content that you could share so you
could share your content with them they can share their content with you and generally that's how it works naturally
anyway in the web sphere if somebody likes your content they're going to link to it they don't necessarily have to
wait for you to ask them but it might not be a bad idea to understand who else is out there that has content somewhat
of yours so that you can you know get a link on that particular website or blog post and so some other ideas behind
having external links pointing back to your website is social media so social
media is not just Facebook or Twitter but it expands beyond that there's
there's core there's media there's all sorts of content generated websites like
Reddit so the list goes on and on you just need to find what's relevant for your content if it's relevant for your
content then it's worth putting or trying to get the external link on that social media platform and then again
going back to my ice cream blog recipes blog post yeah if you find a particular
blog that you want to have an external link on there's nothing wrong with reaching out to that particular blogger
you know in some cases very flattering but in other cases if the content is relevant then why not it's only going to
help your end user experience if you add somebody who has a say a Blog about
cakes having their link on your blog post so there's nothing wrong with it because it also adds to the user
experience and if you're going to ask somebody to put an external link on theirs you might want to be open-minded
and make sure that you're are able and willing to put an external link on your
blog post or website pointing to their content that's how the web Works especially if the contents of quality
relevant and of good nature okay so let's move on and finish up with the
Do's and Don'ts in SEO
do's and don'ts of SEO so we talked a lot about why SEO what is SEO how do we
rank for SEO what is on page SEO what is off-page SEO and so let's just wrap up
with some of the things you again want to do to rank your page for a particular keyword and some of the things you don't
want to do so the first thing on the list is optimize for white hat techniques and what I mean for opting in
for white hat techniques is basically everything I just mentioned today you want to do keyword research you want to
choose a natural language processing form format so you could choose keywords
that are going to be relevant natural to the content and you don't want to opt for black cat techniques and blad hat
techniques are probably not even worth going into detail but one example is choosing a keyword arbitrarily like say
digital marketing and just stuffing that keyword into the content so that's probably not something you want to do
because again it's not going to be good for the end user so stay away from black hat and focus on some of the techniques
we talked about in today's presentation the other do we want to do is get backlinks from relevant sites so that's
off page SEO again it's what I mentioned earlier it's about linking your quality
content to another person's website that also has quality content we don't want
to have a backlink from an irrelevant site why because it's not going to be relevant and it's also going to hurt our
Authority because if it's on a site that's not of good quality then Google's going to look at us and say well this
site is linking to your site but it's not relevant so therefore you know we're not going to look at you in this same
way as if you were on a quality website we do want to use our keywords naturally because title tags are what people see
first on organic search but you don't want to use the same title tag on every
page of your website so we want to stay away from doing that so you want to have a unique title tag for every web page on
your website and ideally what does that mean that means using our keyword research to choose one of two keywords
per page and optimizing your web page for those one to two keywords so you
ideally what you want to do is have one or two different keywords for every page on your website we definitely definitely
definitely want to write engaging content so the content should be
engaging remember user experience we want users to stay on our website we
want them to enjoy the content that they're reading and we want them to go from one page to another naturally we
definitely don't want to leverage or plagiarize or just copy content from others websites because it's not one
probably going to be relevant to what you're writing about two it's duplicate content and it's somebody else's so
that's a black cat Technique we want to stay away from I can't emphasize this enough we need to do keyword research
first before you do anything else you need to find relevant keywords and not only that you need to understand the
volume and the competition for each of those keywords okay you don't want to choose a key word that has low volume
High competition you want to choose a keyword that has high volume low
competition but above all you want to choose keywords that are relevant to
your content we want to avoid keyword stuffing so don't take a keyword and just stuff it everywhere on the page
it's not going to be natural and Google's going to be able to pick up on that so we want to maintain some level
of quality with our content and quality with the keyword that we choose so
reminder when you have quality content it's always going to link internally to
another page on your website with quality content but it's got to be natural and don't just build site-wide
backlinks meaning don't just have an internal link to the home page or don't
have every page on your website linking to just one page so internal linking
should be natural naturally linking from one page to another not only does it help Google understand and crawl all the
web pages on your website but it's good for the end User it's good user experience and certainly last but
something I didn't talk about does take time to rank your content so remember the process you're going to write your
content you're going to choose keywords you're going to change the elements on that page for those keywords and all the
while you're going to make sure Google can crawl that content and when they crawl they're going to index it the
process to takes time especially if you choose a keyword that's competitive so just be patient if you have quality
content and you've optimized for on-page SEO and off-page SEO then you will rank
for that keyword and then make sure your website's user friendly and mobile friendly so we talked about responsive
content earlier so remember most users today start the process of search on
mobile so we want to make sure your websites are mobile friendly on-page
On Page SEO
optimization as the name suggests is the practice of optimizing web pages to rank
higher and get relevant traffic from the search engine on-page optimization includes both
content and HTML source code optimization search engine optimization
can be very complex so when you're trying to understand it for the first time I find it very easy just to break
it up into general concepts that you might already have an understanding of when you look at the hundreds of signals
that go into SEO they can be broken up into either relevancy or because
sometimes it's both popularity so relevancy and popularity out of all
these signals they fit into one of these two things we're going to break all the signals we have into these two areas in
this section we're going to talk about the on-page factors that's because these are the factors that you have direct
impact upon and you can make a small tweak and have a big impact with Organic
traffic with your on-page relevancy factors the primary on-page relevancy
factors that I'll cover in this lesson are title tags and meta description header tags which are used for headlines
and subheadings website URLs and URL structure image alt text internal links
keyword usage and sitemaps let's start with one of my favorites and
that is the title tag this is also called a page title the page title is
Title Tags - On Page SEO Techniques
not shown on the page now rather it is displayed on the browser Tab and this is
what makes it highly important is that in addition to being displayed on the browser tab it is also the title tag or
the page title that is shown on the text in the Google search results as the link
to the page the page title influences both the click-through rates and people's first
impressions of our website next up we have the meta description
Now The Meta description can be a bit confusing The Meta description is in the code and
Meta Description - On Page SEO Techniques
it does not influence rankings but it does influence clicks
people will see your snippet or your page information in the search engine
results that gray text is the meta description if you don't have a meta description
then it may pull information from the page you can affect this and improve the
chances of your meta description appearing if you write a short descriptive phrase of the content or the
purpose of the page and just because we edit these elements does not guarantee that they will show
up I often say that we affect the change but we cannot control it
this is because the search engine May override your changes and show different content in these areas
sometimes it may help and it might be a better description but many times it's
not now let's go to the next element the header tags these are also referred to
Header Tags - On Page SEO Techniques
as the heading and subheading and this is how HTML was built when the
web was first created it enables a logical hierarchy of
content so starting with the headline then displaying a subheading and then
subheadings after that the idea here is that you're establishing a hierarchy of information
so you start with the H1 like a newspaper there's only one main headline
per page it describes the main purpose of the page then a subheading the H2 this is how you
break the sub content into subcategories obviously you'll want to use a keyword
in there as well you see by describing the purpose of the page in the headline and then again in a
subheading you're naturally going to use your primary and secondary keywords
because you're going to associate them with the product or the purpose and the benefit
the key is to keep it short you see after the headline are the
subcategories the H2S and then your H3 is typically used as a paragraph heading
now putting the keyword in these headings alone does not make your page optimized
remember the purpose is to provide a quick reference for people to find the content they need within seconds
so short explanatory heading and subheadings paragraph headings are very
effective and naturally you'll be using keywords to help people locate the information
that is most important to them now if we go back to the search engine results page the serp there is another
URL and URL Structure - On Page SEO Techniques
element in that listing the page title is the large Blue text The Meta description is the gray text now the
green text is the URL of the page that is listed this is the address of the page just like the address for your home
the internet knows that the URL is the address for that page this is extremely
important for SEO for a variety of reasons the most important though is your keyword usage I like to make sure
that I have at least one Relevant Word in the URL now also here keep it short
one of the worst things you can do is have a URL full of keywords or even worse hyphenate them all remember people
use these urls they provide context for the page people
also copy and paste URLs into Mobile messages emails and Social Links so it
is extremely important to keep these short succinct and I like to say readable
now I've just briefly touched about the importance of the URL and now let's look
at the URL structure first let's start with the primary core of the URL the domain name
in the example with the URL I have here example.com that's the domain name so
this is the first thing that people see with your online business now be on the internet this is going to
be what's in all of your ads emails brochures business cards and online your
social profiles all of your marketing efforts are going to drive people to this domain there's a lot of advice
about buying or using domains that have your keywords in them and unfortunately domains have been being sold for decades
so there's less chance of finding a domain with the keywords you want now the search engines don't make the
keyword used in the domain a primary ranking signal so that's good however the domain is your business it needs to
be memorable if you have a very I call it a spammy looking domain name with
multiple words and hyphens or one that's hard to spell or confusing people are
going to make an initial impression off of that so make sure you have something that's going to make a great first
impression here's the rule for a domain name something that's easy to spell and
easy to pronounce ideally sure it's something you can type and share some something you're going to be able to put
on a business card and be proud of not something that you bought primarily because you want it for SEO reasons and
you think with that you're going to succeed as an example just think about Amazon their domain name says nothing
about books and yet it grew to be one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world the same with Alibaba or Google
their domain names were not the keyword but their marketing and branding built
their company now everything after the domain is a subdirectory this is based on your website organization as an
example if you have a website selling shoes then the subdirectory can be called shoes it's easy right the sub
directory is the folder that contains the relevant files or Pages for that group think of a file folder with
documents inside the file folder is usually based on a major category of content or products now inside the
folder are individual documents or Pages these files or Pages usually come after
the subdirectory in this example you see the file.html the next step in
optimizing the URL is to name the page in a way that explains the content of the page to use our eCommerce shoe
website a page name would usually be a specific product name this way you would end up with domain name forward slash
shoes as the category forward slash brand name running shoe insert that here
Image Alt Text - On Page SEO Techniques
if you've ever looked at the HTML that make up the instructions of the page you'll understand a bit more of how
search engines get the information from the page the text on the page and the markup such as the headings provide
instructions as to where the text is located the importance and prominence of the text in addition to the arrangement
of the overall page HTML is a set of instructions for a browser to assemble
the page and the search engines use that as well now the search engines spiders cannot see images as the internet
developed many attributes were added to provide for accessibility and additional features users that are site impaired
cannot see images and the alternative text tag describes
the image further there are many times when our bandwidth isn't strong and not all of
the images will load in that case we need the alt text description to provide
the context of the image and its purpose search engines use this alt text
description to gain additional context about the page the content of the image
and its purpose now we have an entire section on links but at this point I
Internal Links - On Page SEO Techniques
just want to cover internal links an internal link is a link from one page on your website to another page of your own
website now this is important from a relevancy perspective you'll see internal links in your main
navigation you'll likely have a link that says home one that says contact us or about our
company what you're showing to search engines and to humans is that this section if
you click on this link is about our company or this is where you find our
contact information you see these links are not votes like external links however they provide
relevance and context to the information on your own website
let's dive in a little more on keywords when a search engine crawls and
Keyword Usage - On Page SEO Techniques
processes your website it doesn't simply look for the instances of specific keywords
it's a lot more complex than that it's using a technology called natural language processing
natural language processing uses algorithms to try to understand the meaning of text
you see search engine processing is attempting to be human this is the same way that people see and
hear the words and we're using the words to find the meaning expressed in the words
similarly when a search engine goes to your website it may see keywords but it's looking for the context of those
words you may say football but just having the word football repeated throughout your
website isn't going to help you rank specifically for football what you need to do and what is more
common in actual human conversation happens very naturally
when we talk about football we use naturally additional words such as goal
and referee and World Cup you see Google and the other search engines are going to take these into account
by usage of other synonyms and other common words you present the context of
a bigger broader idea for your website the next site signal that we have is
Sitemaps - On Page SEO Techniques
site Maps now there are two kinds of site Maps there's the site map that is
for humans and there is the site map that are for search engine robots crawlers or spiders
the one that is for human is called an HTML sitemap you've probably seen these
before the link is generally in the footer of a website if you click on it it shows you the major sections of the
website provide some search functionality but looking at it as a
human it shows you the hierarchy of the website and where to find important information
it shows how everything fits together now there's something else that exists
called an XML sitemap it's not linked from any page of your website but exists as an independent
file on your server now this is something you can see but it
is formatted for search engine spiders using a programming language called XML
it shows the hierarchy and the priority of each of the URLs of the website every
page every document every image and it also shows the date that each page was
last updated or changed so at this point we've covered a lot of things that are important and things
Onpage Do's and Don'ts
that you should be doing when optimizing your on-page content now let's go a different direction and
cover things that you should not be doing keyword stuffing hidden text repetitive anchor text and cloaking the
first one is keyword stuffing now back in the early days of search engine optimization people used to increase the
instances of words on the page now this is well before natural language processing at that time search engines
were looking for occurrences of specific words well search engines they're very
smart about this what may have worked 20 years ago or 10 years ago keyword stuffing does not work
you're not going to rank better for any given phrase by including it a dozen or more times on the page in fact you might
get an over optimization penalty by constantly repeating the same word over
and over focus on writing content that engages with your visitors and uses
language naturally now the next one is hidden text unfortunately I still see
this this is when you write content that is solely for search engines and not for people now typically it is attempted by
writing a lot of repetitive keywords as text coloring it white and placing it
against a white background as you see this was developed as another way to add more keyword stuff text without the user
seeing the overuse of keywords now it didn't work too well in the past and it definitely does not work today
this tactic backfires in two ways first search engines can tell when it's white
text on a white background it's easy to tell from a computer science point of view search engines read the HTML and in
the HTML are the instructions for colors when you hide text modern search engines
are smart enough to figure it out probably better than a human now secondly it's done to hide repetitive
keyword stuff text which is the second thing against you these outdated unprofessional tactics will most likely
get a website penalized by the search engines the next one is repetitive anchor text
you may have followed a link to a page when looking for a business or information and instead of the
information you want you get a page that doesn't feel like it was written for people
every sentence is redundant repetitive and almost every keyword is linked even
when there doesn't need to be a link it confuses the flow of the information on the page now again this used to be a
tactic that sometimes would work but it's no longer helpful
search engines and their natural language processing algorithms have advanced significantly they can tell
when something's not readable when something is probably intended for machines and rankings but not for people
search engines will figure it out please don't waste time on redundant links trying to inflate the relevance of your
links and Pages the last thing to cover here is cloaking cloaking is the idea of
showing one thing to the search engines and something entirely different to humans now this is related to the rest
of the tactics I just covered it's something that used to work but it was expressly against the search engine
guidelines while it may have worked if the search engine is discovered it on your website you could have been
penalized or dropped from the search engine results entirely now we've covered all of the most important
How Perfectly Optimized Page Looks Like?
on-page optimization factors let's take a look at what the theoretically perfectly optimized page would look like
in this example we can see many of these elements being used together you can also see that the base key phrase
digital camera is being repeated but always included with a specific contact
next first at the top of the page is the URL which has digital cameras in the
address the page title follows using the context of the information and adding the word
reviews you can also see at the top of the page that the main navigation and
secondary navigation also called the breadcrumb navigation provides context
of the Page's location within the entire website and natural keyword usage
the H1 headline is the key phrase but also happens to simply be the best title
for the content of the page subsequent subheadings provide additional information such as ratings
recommendations and features the links provide relevant ways to
access additional content the image utilizes alt text there are also clear
calls to action which provide relevant offers to visitors as you can see the context of all of the
content is very strong and sends a clear relevancy signal to both search engines
and readers to conclude this section I'd like to cover the top influencing factors now
sometimes you may find these as lists but I found it a bit more practical to separate them into categories
typically every year you'll find these collections of lists from surveys experts or speculation
some are from testing but honestly you can't ever truly test a search engine as
they change a little bit with every algorithm so the best thing is to take from these
lists these factors that are the tried and true factors over the years that
have worked consistently also those tactics that not only make your website more effective with users
they tend to do well with search engines so if a tactic serves that Dual Purpose
it's a good tactic so these are not exclusive and have to lists for every situation but guides and
indicators for you to use the top on-page factors from surveys opinions
and data are these a relevant page title page headings
anchor text links a keyword-based URL a keyword or contextual file name such
Top On Page SEO Ranking Factors
as page name image name or PDF file name alt text and images and finally what you
do with the content on a page to make it more readable lists bullet points and
bolded text the top factors for off-page linking tend to contain these items
the total number of domains linking to you the number of Highly influential domains
linking to you the number of unique domain IP addresses
the total backlinks without no follow limits the total relevant anchor text in links
to you and finally the types and context of keywords in Anchor text links
the domain also contributes factors to your overall rankings such as the age of
the domain which would include ownership information such as the length of time owned and operated by a company
the real business information tied to that domain such as the business address being the same as the business
registration address for the domain in addition the signals from social
accounts driving visits to the domain functionally the search engines also
utilize some attribution based on the quality of programming of the website
for instance taking care of the basic search engine Protocols of the
robots.txt file XML sitemap and https protocol
websites that Implement these features have shown that they are familiar with search engine guidelines and protocol
now one of the changes over the past few years has been the implementation of page speed as an increasing ranking
Factor slow loading pages with a lot of extraneous code that slow the delivery
of the page will be penalized as they take away from the user experience
optimizing the page code speeding up the load time of the page can directly
impact your rankings and this is closely related to the mobile friendliness of your website
if your website is not mobile friendly it will be limited in visibility as
Google's primary index is focused on mobile devices and mobile delivery
behavioral factors are the newest factors and with the Advent of artificial intelligence it is making
determining the intent and the is making determinings easier for a search engine to derive a judgment
of relevancy based on interaction while the extent of these signals is not
fully known it is suspected that they are minor but growing in importance these include the amount of users that
search for a brand name business's name and go to that result showing brand
awareness also the amount of direct visits bypassing search
time on page pages per session which is also called the depth of visit
and lastly the behavior of a Searcher from the results page how many results
are clicked how many times do they return to the results this evaluation is looking to judge if
the results presented were satisfactory or deficient for that query so let's
Keyword Research in SEO
start with the why we would do keyword research so Jesse is planning to publish
a Blog of pizza recipes so she was doing pizza recipes step by step piece of
recipes with sausage homemade pizza toppings pizza dough recipes thin crust
pizzas she's doing a lot of different topics on pizza recipes well what Jesse
needs to do is understand what's going to drive traffic to these blog posts if she's writing about you know different
topics around pizza recipes so she's Unsure how these blogs are going to
drive traffic so she really needs to understand that hey you need to choose
the right keywords to drive traffic so the question is if you're writing a blog post about recipes with sausages is
pizza recipes with sausages or recipes for free the best keyword to use maybe
maybe not so you need to take uh care and shoes in the queue words to align
with your content so that's really the idea of why we would do keyword research because some of the issues with keywords
that are poorly chosen are they could have slow search volume for example you may choose a keyword that just a lot of
people aren't using to search for or they can be highly competitive so if you choose a keyword that's very broad or
popular it can be very competitive and take you a long time to be found for that keyword or you could just make the
mistake of choosing a keyword that is in aligned with your content or you can choose keywords but use them incorrectly
with your content so these are some of the issues that you can encounter if you just go about choosing keywords randomly
without due diligence without the proper research so low search volume will lead
to less traffic High competition session you may not even rank at all okay if somebody finds you for a keyword that's
not relevant to the topic they're just going to leave the page and if you're not using the right keywords and or if
you are using the right keywords and not using them correctly in the content then your pages may not even be found in
organic search so you really have to take care and choosing the keywords to me that's the most important step with
SEO is keyword research so we're going to talk about the types of keyword research then so we have short tail
Types of Keyword Research
keywords and we have long tail keywords so if you write a blog post about pizza recipes well what are you going to
choose a short tail or long tail so let's talk about short tail keywords first so short tail keywords are
keywords that are usually three keywords in a phrase or shorter in some cases it
may be two keywords in a phrase or shorter so short tip keywords usually have high search volume which means
likely means higher competition but what it all also means it could be lower
conversions because short sale keywords like for example pizza recipes could be considered a short choke heat word but
maybe somebody's looking for homemade pizza recipes or pizza recipes from their favorite Italian restaurant so
short taking words may not be as relevant so if we compare it with long tail keywords chances are you're going
to have lower competition that's one of the benefits but you're also going to have lower search volume but with longer
tail keywords the key word is probably going to be more relevant with the content you're writing about so
therefore the conversion rates likely going to be higher so that's really the difference between short-term keywords
and long tail keywords if you want to look at simplistically short tail keywords are Broad in nature it's going
to capture a lot of eyeballs but those eyeballs may look at your content as not relevant versus long tail keywords that
may be very relevant but not as many eyeballs on them so short tail keywords the characteristics they're not as
Short Tail Keywords
specific usually they're less than three words they have high search volume and
high competition so if you just choose pizza recipes could take you a while to rank for that keyword but when you rank
you're going to get the traffic but again it may not convert because the key word is Broad in nature so pizza recipes
is a short tail keyword that may not be exactly what you're writing about in
Long Tail Keywords
your blog post so it may draw a lot of traffic but the traffic may not do anything so the longer tail keywords are
very specific they consist of more than three words in the search query they have relatively low search volume
competition so the chance of you ranking higher faster for that long take word is
probably going to be greater because not many other websites are trying to rank for that same keyword and so the benefit
of that is if you have let's just say homemade pizza recipes with mushrooms
that's a long tail key word but if somebody's looking for that type of pizza recipe then you know know you're
going to track the right traffic and chances are that traffic's going to engage or convert based on the type of
conversion you have in place so example would be homemade pizza dough recipes that'd be another example more than
thick keywords in the phrase very specific we're talking about homemade pizza dough recipe so we're not talking
about just pizza recipes so it's a little bit more uh specific in nature longer tail so these keywords are used
for targeted Pages including blog posts if you're writing a blog post specifically about pizza recipes with
homemade dough then this is the key word you likely would want to use versus just pizza recipes so let's look at an
example between a short tail keyword and a long tail keyword and to accentuate
the differences we're going to use Google's Keyword Planner tool so
Google's keyboard Planner tool is located in Google ads the Google ads platform and when you're in the Google
ads platform you can simply click click on tools and then Keyword Planner and so what Keyword Planner allows us to do is
get a sense of the type of volume that a particular keyword has so what Google's
Keyword Planner does is they show you the average monthly searches this is the average monthly search volume of a
keyword over the past 12 months and so in this example we're going to choose pizza recipes and homemade pizza dough
recipes so one short tail and one long tail so we enter those keywords in we're going to click get results and what
Google's going to do is it's going to show us the volume of those keywords so
for pizza recipe we could see the average monthly search volume is 33 100
for pizza recipe so note that pizza recipe and pizza recipes are closely
related keywords and so what Google does is they consider that a close variance so meaning if somebody ties a piece of
recipe then they're also in Google's eyes looking for pizza recipes so it's a
close variance and so for the keyword pizza recipe which is short tail we
could see on average over the past 12 months this keyword received 33 100
queries and so if we hover over the graph we could see basically the volume
the average volume per month so here I could see for this particular keyword here the volume per month is 33 1000 and
then I could see the actual volume over the past 12 months and then for the long
tail keyword I can see homemade pizza dough recipe again close variants
homemade pizza dough recipes I can see over the past 12 months with the search volume is for this on average is 2400
but I could see here in December the volume went up to 3600 but for example
in May it was 1900. so it's gonna fluctuate a bit over the past 12 months
but on average it's about 2400 so shorter tail a lot more volume longer
tail not as much volume but nonetheless there is volume here and so these are
the difference between a short tail and a longer tail and so well Google's Keyword Planner also does is allow us to
get a sense of what the competition is and so here I can see the competition is low for both of these keywords fair
enough so we now know that if we want to optimize or choose the keyword homemade
pizza dough recipe for our blog post we know for ranked on page one of Google
even in the top spot we can expect about 2400 search queries for that keyword now
whether you get all 2400 clicks for that keyword remains to be seen chances are
you're not going to get all 2400 you're going to get a Lion's Share of those clicks but you're going to at least get
some volume on it so even the longer tick keywords have a lot of Promise because there is some search volume here
for this keyword how to do a proper keyword research so we looked at Google's Keyword Planner tool in Google
How To Do Keyword Research
ads and we typed in two keywords and we were able to get a sense of what the average volume is so we definitely want
to choose keywords based on the following factors we want to choose it based on search volume search volume is
a good indicator of the potential traffic we can obtain so again for the keyword homemade pizza dough recipe we
know that it averages 2400 a month in search volume again we may not get all
2400 but we're going to get a line share of that we also need to look at competition and so Google's Keyword
Planner gives us a high medium or low in terms of the competition but if you're
somebody who wants to get a better sense of what the competition is and you should because competition is a key
component in choosing keywords and so what I want to do is get a sense of how many people are actually optimizing for
that keyword so Google's Keyword Planner tool is going to give me a low medium high really what I want to do is get a
better sense of that numerically so what I can do is go into Google search and I
can type in pizza recipes and I could see there's about 1 billion results that's a lot of results however that
means that every potential web page out there on the internet that mentions
pizza recipes is going to be included in this number here and so I want to get a better sense of who's optimizing for
pizza recipes so I'm going to put in the all in title syntax and so what that is
going to ask Google to do is tell me all the websites that have pizza recipes the
keyword pizza recipes in the title tag so if I do all entitle colon space then
pizza recipes my result drops down to 336 000. so what that tells me is that
there are 336 000 results with the keyword pizza recipes in the title tag now if I want
to focus in on my other keyword if I choose my other keyword was a longer
tail keyword homemade pizza dough recipe so if I type that keyword in the homemade pizza dough recipe or recipes
remember close variance and I just click enter or type the keyword in hit my
Enter key I'm going to get 35 Million results but again is that really an
indicator of the type of competition I have no because every listing that mentions homemade pizza dough recipes is
going to be included in the search results so I'm going to type in my all in title colon space and then I'm going
to get a better sense of how many websites have the keyword homemade pizza
dough recipes in the title tag and I get 2160 different results so here I can see
the first result in the title tag homemade pizza dough recipe second one homemade pizza dough recipe so these are
are sites or web pages that have that keyword in the title tag so now I have a
numerical number to work with and so the thing you have to understand about SEO specifically about keyword research is
you need to do research on a few different keywords not just one or two so what we want to do is have a
spreadsheet the spreadsheet is going to contain keywords that we can potentially want to optimize for choose as keywords
to optimize for SEO and so my recommendation is you come up with a theme first so the theme for us in this
exercise is pizza recipes and so that's our theme so we chose the keyword pizza
recipes so the close variance here is pizza recipe what was the volume well we
know the volume was 33 100 for pizza recipe so what are we going to do we're going to put that number in in our
volume column what was the competition well if we go back and type in pizza
recipes it was 680 three thousand so I'm going to type in 683
000. what was our next keyword well it was pizza or homemade pizza dough recipes so if I go back for this
particular keyword is 2400 so I'm going to put 2400 in under my volume column and then what was my competition well my
competition was I typed that keyword back in 2160. so I'm gonna put two thousand one
hundred and sixty so now I have an idea of what kind of volume and what kind of
competition I have now you want to do this for a number of different keywords and when you do it for a number of
keywords what you do want to do is obviously choose a relevant keyword that has high volume and low competition so
another way of saying it is the volume or ratio of volume to competition and so
basically what we could do is take volume divided by competition if I make that a percentage I can see it's point
three five percent is the ratio between volume the competition if I do the same for my longer tail keyword 2400 divided
by 2160 I can see that 111 so this just
kind of proves the point that yeah I'm still going to get some volume but I have a better chance of ranking for this
longer tier keyword homemade pizza dough recipes so you want to be able to do that for a number of keywords and
examine the volume the competition and the ratio between volume and competition for your themed keywords in this case
pizza recipes so relevancy you want to choose keywords that are very relevant
to the content that you're writing and then again commercial intent what keywords are going to drive more
conversions and revenue for the business so when we talk about commercial intent we're talking about you know are you
choosing keywords that are going to get somebody to do what you want them to do so we could say You Know download pizza
dough recipes so somebody's typing in the keyword download pizza dough recipes then chances are they're going to find
you come to your side and take action by downloading that pizza dough recipe so you want to be able to also think about
the intent of the key word is it going to help you drive conversions and revenue if you're an e-commerce site so
search volume is the average monthly search volume made for a particular keyword and phrase so we can get that
number using Google's Keyword Planner tool in the Google ads platform we want
to Target keywords with high search volume that will help bring traffic to the website we want volume but we want
to take into account seasonality as well so that's where the Google's Keyword Planner tool comes in place because if
we go back again we can just hover over we can get a sense of any particular
Trend going on or season out so for example if I saw a large growth in the
winter months and not much volume growth in the summer months then that might
indicate to me that this keyword is more popular during the wintertime time so pay attention to the grass that you know
the Keyword Planner tool gives you use them to your advantage to take into account seasonality so a good example
would be funny Halloween costumes well we know that for Halloween you're going
to have a spike probably towards the end of September all the way through October and then it's going to drop after
October 31st which is Halloween so that's an example but in the case of pizza recipes you know you may find that
more people are choosing to search for pizza recipes during maybe the summer
months versus the winter months so pay attention to seasonality it will affect search volume so competition based on
our example it's one of the most important key metrics you don't want to choose a key word that's highly
competitive because if it's competitive then it's going to be harder to rank number one or even on page one of Google
depending on competitive it is so high search for I Am low competition in other
words is the ratio between the two is the ideal combination so going back to
the spreadsheet recommend you have that spreadsheet handy put your theme in place okay theme pizza recipes we use
Google's Keyword Planner tool to find the volume we use the all entitled syntax to find the competition so we
entered both of those numbers in and we get our ratio and so when you have these numbers for a number of different
keywords you want to be able to choose that ratio of high volume low competition but always relevancy always
trumps ratio so always go with a key word that is going to be relevant to
your content don't choose a keyword that's not relevant if you choose a keyword that's not relevant it's not
going to bode well for user engagement so the difficulty of a keyword ranges
from 0 to 100 in Google's keyword tool so it's going to be easy it's going to
be medium it's going to be hard but my recommendation is also to get the new numerical factor and that's the all in
title syntax and again relevancy is what drives the traffic to your website and
keep the traffic there on your website and also not only will keep the traffic on your website but hopefully get that
traffic to engage and convert so that's the key about relevancy you always want to choose keywords that are relevant to
your content even if it's sacrificing volume relevancy again trumps volume and
competition so always choose relevant keywords first so when you do that you're always almost guaranteeing that
at some point somebody's going to find your content because somebody out there might be looking for it and if they do
you're going to get found and then the engagement is going to be better so understand your business find keywords
that are relevant to your business and then focus on those keywords that'll help you with getting the right traffic
to your site always keep in mind the commercial intent so these keywords are more specific and result in conver
version rate for example buying is a good commercial intent keyword so if you
really want somebody to come to your website and buy then focus on those types of keywords in the case of the
pizza recipes maybe it's download could be our commercial intent keyword again there may be low search volume but those
are the type of keywords you want to focus on because that's the type of traffic you want to drive to your site
so some other examples a commercial intent keywords or discount deal your
coupon shipping you know don't be afraid to use some of these keywords as part of your longer tail keyword phrase again
the volume may not be high but the traffic quality is probably going to be better so keyword research is the
foundation for SEO so if you have chosen your keywords properly then if you do
get ranked for those keywords then it's going to lead to better engagement with
some conversions and so when we talk about keywords we also want to talk about our primary and secondary keywords
so every page should have at least a primary keyword and then a second carry
keyword to work with so primary keywords are really defining the nature of your content the secondary keywords are
relevant to the primary keyword so why do we choose a primary and secondary keyword because you may choose a keyword
as a primary keyword that is relevant to the content but may not necessarily rank
very high or have a lot of volume that's secondary keyword is also relevant to
the primary keyword but also relevant to content and you may rank for that secondary keyword so you always want to
go with two keywords versus just one keyword you want to give your yourself a chance to rank for at least two
different types of keywords of relevant nature so for web page there can be several secondary keywords but only one
primary keyword so your primary keyword is always going to be relevant to your content secondary keywords can be
relevant to the keyword but and you may have multiple secondary keywords but
it's also going to be related to the content and it gives you a better opportunity to be found between both the
primary and secondary and search Okay so let's take a look at another example of
how to use primary keywords and secondary keywords when choosing keywords so if our primary keyword is
healthy diet plan remember healthy diet plan is directly related to the content so that's what we're talking about but
these secondary keywords are also related to content and play off the primary keyword and so what we want to
do is go to cool Google's Keyword Planner tool and get an idea of the volume for healthy diet plan and then
also the volume and competition for some of these secondary keywords like healthy diet for weight loss healthy diet food
low carb diet healthy meal plans and diet plan weight loss so if I go in to
Google's Keyword Planner and type those keywords in I'm going to choose get results and now here I can see healthy
diet plan keyword I'm focusing on is my primary keyword has an average monthly
search volume of 9900 and then some of my secondary keywords healthy diet foods
diet plan weight loss low carb diet you know Google will give me a number of
different keywords to work with so I'm going to look at the search volume of those as well and so ideally what I want
to do is be able to then look at the volume and then look at the competition so healthy diet plan to go into my
keyword analysis here that's my theme so that's my keyword what's my volume for
healthy diet plan nine thousand nine hundred what's my competition so my
competition is seventy four thousand seven hundred and that's going to give me a ratio of volume to competition of
13 so that's what my content's about that's a considered a short tail keyword
because it has a lot of competition and so my ratio is 13 and what I want to do
is I want to be able to put these other secondary keywords it's in here as well maybe even go to a little longer tail
because I want to be able to find two key release two keywords I want to be
able to find my primary keyword that's relevant to my content and then I want to be able to find my secondary keyword
which is again related to the primary keyword which is also related to the content and so I want to be able to
choose two keywords basically and I want to choose two keywords that are relevant that have good ratio between volume and
competition so that's the whole idea again I'm how to do keyword research you want to be able to find your keywords
use the tools available to you and get a sense of what the volume is what the
competition is look at the ratio between the volume and competition and then based on the content choose that primary
keyword and then again based on the keyword you chose choose some secondary keywords as well because you want to be
found for not just one keyword but multiple keywords okay let's look at some alternative suggestions to key
keyword research so for doing keyword research we want to take into account
LSI keywords we could take into account other platforms that host a lot of
content like quora or Reddit we can use Google suggestions in the keyword search
bar we can use popular platforms like Wikipedia and we can use social media
bookmarking like Reddit so there are lots of suggestions that we can obtain
from various sources so let's start with LSI keywords and LSI stands for latent
semantic insect indexing and so basically what it is it's just keywords that I'll link to your primary keyword
and so when you're choosing keywords you always want to choose that primary keyword and then secondary keywords that
are similar to the primary keyword and usually those are LSI or latent semantic
indexing type keywords so they're used to drive relevant traffic to your page
so if you're focus in on one keyword we want to to have other keywords that are similar to increase our visibility on
the search engine result pages so we could find latent semantic indexing right in search so if we use the term
healthy diet if we go to Google search for example if I type in healthy diet and Google search all I need to do is
scroll to the bottom of the page and I can see searches related to healthy diet so healthy diet menu healthy diet essay
what does a healthy diet look like notice at the top Google's also given me some other suggestions here so they're
saying low-fat diet veganism gluten-free diet so there's lots of different
suggestions right in Google search bar so all of these are LSI related keywords
so if you're optimizing a page for a healthy diet then you could choose low-fat diet as a secondary keyword you
can use gluten-free diet as a secondary keyword it really depends on what the content is but you always want to
support your content with as much LSI keywords as possible so you can be found
for as many different keywords as possible in Google search so it's important because if you have a Blog
that you know talks about python so how do the search engines know if the website python is about the programming
language or the snake so Google for example uses LSI keywords to understand
what the page is specifically focusing on so if you're just focusing on Python and your content you want to support
that with LSI keywords and so that will allow your web page to better
communicate with Google also to have the visibility to show up on search so they can certainly improve your search
positioning and featured Snippets as well so if you have a keyword that
answers a question you could certainly found for feature snippet for example maybe you know healthy diet recipes if I
type that in you can see here there's a featured snippet so if I'm talking about recipes that's a key word I may want to
use and if I use that then Google has an opportunity to see what my content's
about and place my information at the top in this featured snippet you can also again see what some of the
questions are being asked what mails are good for weight loss what is a good healthy diet plan all of these can be
keyword phrases that you can use so the answers are right here in Google so Cora is a great platform because core is a
platform that people go and ask questions in a community responds with
answers or responses to that particular question or topic and so the great thing
about core is it's a good eye is a good place for you to go to get some ideas about a specific topic so if we're
talking about healthy dieting so we can find keywords with high search volume writing quora so the whole idea is you
can look at you know the top five questions for specific topic like healthy dieting and find relevant
keywords to healthy dieting so if you just type in that particular keyword in quora you're going to probably get some
responses to questions or responses to somebody else's question and so if we
take a look at core for example so if I just type in healthy dieting what I'm going to do is I'm going to get some
responses to the the topic healthy dieting so what's the best diet for Healthy Living what are the top five
tips for a healthy diet habit so all of these could be keyword phrases that you
could take away with for your own content and so the benefit here is you're getting kind of an idea of what's
trending what people are talking about and if you use tips for a healthy diet
habit for example and you optimize for that well again that could turn around and bode well for you because you could
be featured in Google as a featured snippet at the top here you can also turn around and use LSI related keywords
for healthy diet habits and you can simply just look for those LSI keywords right in Google remember at the bottom
or at the top up if I scroll down I could see some related LSI keywords at the bottom so writing Google as well you
could see in the Google search bar that Google provides some LSI related
keywords to your query so if I go back here and type in healthy diet recipes I
can see here Google's suggesting some other related keywords healthy diet menu healthy diet for men healthy diet foods
healthy diet for women so these are all LSI related keywords that you can use to
support your primary keyword and the content you're writing about so we've talked about LSI keywords where to find
them so they're found right here they can be found at the top of Google and they can be found at the bottom you can
also then go to core as well and get some ideas for the types of questions that are being asked so if you ask a
question and use that as your keyword phrase then again you have an opportunity of showing up for a featured
snippet in Google just by doing some additional research within Google itself or on quora so according to Google the
autocomplete predictions are automatically generated by Google's algorithm without any human intervention
it's based on a number of factors but the primary factor is how often past users have searched for terms so Google
collects all the keyword queries that somebody types in and they're suggesting some of the most popular terms that
people have typed in so if I go back to Google again if I start to type in recipes I could see some of the other
queries that somebody else has typed in or some of the most popular queries related to that topic so if you enter
the keyword healthy diet Google's going to suggest multiple keyword suggestions that users have asked in the past and
you could certainly get the search volume of those keywords just by looking in Google itself I can see for healthy
diet recipes billions of pages related to healthy diet recipes I can also get the search volume by going into Google's
Keyword Planner so if I type in healthy diet I'm gonna to be able to see what my search volume is for that keyword and in
addition I can see the seasonality of that particular keyword and in addition
to that Google's going to provide some other related keywords to my search query so if I'm looking for healthy diet
Google's going to suggest hey maybe you should choose healthy food or healthy eating or how to lose weight so those
are LSI related keywords that Google provides in the keyword plan which is
built into the Google ads platform another option for you is Wikipedia so Wikipedia is a vast platform of content
so we could turn Wikipedia into our own assets and use it to our own Advantage
by finding relevant keywords in an easy fashion so with Wikipedia we can
identify a list of keywords in The Meta description itself we could choose keywords from the first paragraph of
Wikipedia that has many relevant keywords or we could take a look at keywords from the Wikipedia content
section so we can also see additional Pages like the see also section that
gives relevant keywords that you're looking for we can also look at the references section as they contain
relevant keywords so go to Wikipedia as an example and I type in healthy diet
into Wikipedia here I can get just in the first paragraph alone I can see some
additional keywords that I might choose to use like micronutrients I never knew
that micronutrients was related to healthy diet but Wikipedia is providing some information about what
micronutrients is and maybe I can use that as a keyword an LSI related keyword
to my content so if I scroll down I get to see also section so it might give me some information food information
consumers for example dietary guidelines I can look at categories like dietetics
and diets I can also look at the references section so I can also see
what what information was provided like health effects of overweight and obesity I can look at diet and physical activity
so all of these are related to my main keyword healthy diet so the answers are
right in here on the platform they're just all over the page so Wikipedia has an abundance of information you just
need to know where to look so again with Wikipedia you can look no further in the first paragraph you look no further than
the C also section the references section category section there's lots of information right on the page itself to
help you get ideas for keywords so if you Google your keyword with Wikipedia
term in the search query and get relevant keywords from the title tags on the serp so you can also do that as well
so if I type in healthy diet Wikipedia and search I can also get some information here as well so people also
search for healthy food advantages or healthy food habits essay or information
about healthy food all of these are related to my keyword healthy diet so
again another bit of information for you to choose or look to choose some
additional keywords for so Reddit it's a popular Community where people post content and discuss a variety of topics
so that's what Reddit is so with the help of subreddits an individual can
find relevant keywords with with high search volume so in Reddit there's an easy way to find out keywords they have
a keyword tool called keyword it so the keyword it gives the average monthly searches for a particular keyword so if
we type a Word in key Reddit and choose keywords from the auto generated list this tool will extract the keywords and
give us those relevant terms with search volume so if we go to the keyword it and Show an example of that for example
healthy food if I get keywords I can see what keywords are relevant in the search
volume of that keyword so if I just type in healthy food keyword it tool is going to tell me some relevant keywords in
which the volume is so if you don't have the Keyword Planner tool in Google ads available to you this is a good
alternative solution to finding keywords so it's free you just need to go to
keyword.com type in your keyword click get keywords and what it's going to do
is give you some relevant keywords related to your primary keyword with the
search volume let's talk about keyword clustering now so the whole idea about
keyword clustering is to really take advantage of the keywords that we're
optimizing for to gain higher rankings so if we can cluster keywords together in a theme and that theme of keywords is
relevant to a specific page of a website then we have a better opportunity to rank so in other words why do we have to
Target just one keyword when we can Target many so keep in mind you know LSI
keywords we want to group a bunch of keywords together that are similar for Content so for example after some
keyword research search you can thematically group keywords into a core topic so for example we can cluster
these group of keywords together like for example what is SEO how does SEO work intro to SEO what are the basics of
SEO all of those are related to The Core theme what is SEO another cluster of
keywords for example could be SEO techniques SEO best practices tips and tricks website optimization on-page SEO
techniques Etc so those are clusters of keywords okay that we can group together in themes and if we group keywords
together in themes we can apply that to a particular content on our website so
the whole idea behind clustering keywords it's going to provide more diversity more of an opportunity for us
to be found so that's the whole idea behind clustering so some additional
steps remember stay up to date on industry news to brainstorm your ideas
first and identify by a list of keywords like ethema keywords that you can
cluster together and then you could determine the keywords that your competitors are already ranking for so
for example if we want to rank for the keyword SEO best practices for example
we can use a tool called keyword Moz if I go to keyword the keyword Explorer
tool and Moz and just type in SEO best practices what it's going to do is it's
going to give me some volume related to that particular keyword but more importantly what it's also going to do
is going to show me what pages are already ranked for that particular keyword so therefore I can get a sense
of who is already ranking for that keyword so here I can see Moz Moz medium.com alexa.com so I can get a
sense of what web pages are ranked for a particular keyword or group of keywords
I want to write for myself so if we look at tools for keyword research look no
further than Moz that's the mods of the tool I would just use but you could also use Google's Keyword Planner which we
used in the example so for example if I go back to the Google ads Keyword Planner if you're in Google ads you
click on tools you click on Cleveland planner and what Keyword Planner does is it provides you for a particular keyword
the average monthly search volume of the past 12 months it provides you information on seasonality so if I hover
my mouse over a graph I'm going to be able to see the volume per month over the last 12 months what the keyboard
planner also does is it provides me some additional ideas for my particular
keyword and in addition to that it's going to provide me some sense of how competitive that keyword is by telling
me whether it's low medium or high in terms of competition so there's sem Raj there's also other additional keywords
tools out there like word stream or href or the Reddit tool keyword it and then
Moz is is another tool I particularly you so if I go to Moz again here I can
just type in a keyword that I'm interested in it's going to give me the search volume of that keyword it's going
to give me the level of difficulty so 50 out of 100 so it's halfway between
difficulty and easy and then it's going to give me some additional metrics like for example what my expected organic
click-through rate would be if I were to rank for this keyword but more importantly what I like about this is we
could see exactly what other sites are linked to this particular keyword we're
interested in so here I can look at the top 10 list so this is mozz's keyword Explorer tool so that's what this tool
is and it's part of moz.com so there's a lot of tools at your disposal I
Tools For Keyword Research
particularly use Moz I particularly use Google's Keyword Planner and those are the tools I use but there are lots of
tools out there so if we order review everything we talked about with keyword research we started with why keyword
research so we want to always take a look at what keywords have a good ratio
of volume and competition so we always want high volume and low competition we
always want relevancy for our keyword and we always want to choose a primary keyword and secondary keywords so that's
things to look for when we talk about you know doing keyword research we want
to look for high volume low competition relevancy and also commercial intent are
we selling a product and do we want to use keywords like the word by in our keyword phrase that's going to get
somebody to purchase that product if they type in a similar keyword with Buy in it as an example so that's why and
how to do keyword research we talked about the types of different keywords that we can focus in on we specifically
talked about short tail keywords and long tail keywords so short tail keywords are going to be three words or
less in the keyword phrase they're always going to have high volume but most likely they're going to also have
high competition so it might take you longer to rank for that short tail
keyword because there's a lot of other websites who also want to rank for that keyword so my recommendation again is
stay away from short tail keywords because it's going to take you longer to rank now you can focus on longer tail
keywords now these keywords are more specific they're more than three words in the keyword phrase they're likely
going to have lower search volume but it's going to be more specific and it's probably going to bring more quality
traffic to your site so an example of a long tail keyword would be homemade
pizza dough recipes that's what we looked at earlier so you can always pick keywords that are longer tail but also
relevant to your content and again the benefits quality traffic and probably higher engagement then we looked at
alternative suggestions to doing keyword research we talked about LSI keywords so
LSI keywords or latent semantic indexing so we want to take a look at keyword words that are relevant or related to
your primary keyword we looked at other platforms where you can go and find other relevant keywords we talked about
quora we talked about Google suggestions in terms of their search engine and their toolbar talked about Wikipedia
going to Wikipedia and using the categories or references section we talked about Reddit with the keyword
tool that allows you to see you know keywords in the search volume there and again that's a free tool to use so you
have lots of suggestions lots of tools at your disposal like Moz sem rush so
there's no shortage of places you can go to to find keywords the key takeaways
really is find keywords that are relevant stick with longer tail you know find supporting LSI related keywords
choose your keywords wisely in terms of commercial intent and then stay away from keywords that are highly
competitive because the more competition for keyword the longer it is going to take you to be found for that keyword
work we then finished up with keyword clustering so group your keywords together in a theme so remember if we
cluster keywords together in a Content theme then likely it's going to be more relevant for the content it's going to
give us a better opportunity found for a variety of keywords definitely use the tools to your advantage some are free
some are not my suggestion on using different tools is to try them out see
how the user interface works for you see what kind of data that these different tools provide are they easy to use and
does it provide all the different information you're looking for like competition or who else is ranking for a
particular keyword or the volume and some of the other metrics that you may need to do your keyword research so try
your own tools out and see what you like you don't necessarily have to go with our suggestions but certainly the likes
of Moz or sem rush or Google's Keyword Planner are always popular amongst people who do SEO in the section on on
Off Page SEO
page optimization we talked about fact factors that centered on relevancy in this section we're going to go in a
different direction we're going to talk about the signals that focus on popularity so what does popularity mean
in this context well it's actually quite simple popularity always relates to links to hyperlinks on the web so you
have seen these when you see the typically blue text that is underlined what this is is a tool it's a ahref
technically in HTML that is pointing from one web document to a different one this is a pretty simple concept I
imagine you already know this so what does this mean from an SEO perspective well it turns out that this
gigantic group of signals the ones related to hyperlinks are and are and historically have been the Lion's Share
of signals that the search engines process when trying to rank pages now there's one big problem with these
from an SEO perspective is that they are historically and today very difficult to
influence this is because they do not take place on your website they take place elsewhere it's other people who are linking to you generally speaking
and this makes them very very difficult to have an influence on so this is a good thing and a bad thing it's a good
thing because it it turns out to be a great metric for ranking web documents it's a bad thing because it's hard for
us to make an impact on day-to-day level hands down the most time consuming and difficult part of SEO is link building
now there's a lot of reasons for this primarily because it's constantly changing and because of all the elements
that are involved with this but the big the bigger takeaway here is that there's no one-size-fits-all solution for link
building you have to take the context of your business of your website and you have to apply general principles to that
so in this video we're going to cover these general principles so you can figure out how to apply those to your business
these principles are and I think these are the most clever and the most important ones are creating link worthy content
proactively participate in an off-site engagement and utilizing offline relationships the tried and true method
for building links is creating content that's optimized for humans so let me explain what this means the currency of
the internet if you will is the content itself that's why people go on they want to read the newest article or they want to see the newest video whatever it may
be that is what has been true since the beginning and I have no doubt will be true going forward so as an SEO or as an
online marketer in general you can use this to your advantage creating the content that people are going to want to share with their friends whether they're
going to want to cite in any kind of paper or whatever they're working on that is a tried and true way of getting links this is what we call the power of
content you can do all kinds of bells and whistles you can go do these newest tactics you can try all these different things out but at the end of the day
what's really important is the content itself so this is what I focus on this is where 80 of my time goes on when I'm
working on link building it's on the content itself can I create something that is just truly that is so truly
great that someone essentially has to link to it this is what I focus on trying to answer and while there is no
simple answer to that go and ask that question always sets you in the right direction the next strategy that I want to talk
about is actually very counter-intuitive so if you're trying to build links to your own website I found one of the most
effective ways and this is consistently true is to engage off your own site now
this doesn't make any sense right why would you work on other people's websites if you're trying to promote your yourself well think about human
beings human beings are much more likely to link and give back to people to human beings that they know well so a lot of
the time I spend when I'm doing link building is spent off-site engaging with others so sometimes this is through
social media so I'll use whatever the latest social network is and I'll chat with people there who have similar interests or have similar interests to
what I'm trying to promote be it a different topic or be it a new industry altogether I'll spend a lot of time
promoting others and a lot of times chatting with other people building up genuine real relationships with human
beings so that when it comes time for them to write an article or when it's when they're ready to link out to other people I'm the first person they think
too and they link back to my website one of the reasons that link building is so hard is because the internet moves so fast asked what worked yesterday might
not work tomorrow so one of the most clever and easy ways to avoid this problem is to just simply
go offline utilize some of the relationships that you have off of the internet in order to benefit on the
internet this is something I try to do all the time because it consistently works by far the easiest favors to cash
in on are the ones that you're already owed so these might be from your friends who you work with it might be from friends who from childhood these are
people who you actually know in the real world who are much more likely to help you when you're trying to promote new
content online so what I'm trying to do link building one of the things I focus on is people that I know in the real world
so this can be lots of things this can be personal friends who happen to have websites and blogs this can be friendly
competition you have or friendly allies you have in your space just saying hey we're looking for these kind of things can you help us out and maybe I'll help
you out somewhere else it's utilizing these relationships that Exist Elsewhere so that you can start gaining these links yourself
if that doesn't work if maybe you don't have any friends in these Arenas you can always go to local businesses and local
agencies so sometimes this is a government-owned thing sometimes this is just third parties all together
there's lots of things that they need help with that you as a business owner or you as trying to promote some client may be able to help them with and if you
can help them offline they're more much more likely to help you online well link building it's very important to understand that not all links are are
created equally a link coming from the home page of CNN is going to provide a lot of what we call link Equity it's
gonna have a lot of popularity metrics tied to it and so it's going to be more valuable to you and help you rank higher
whereas a link also coming from the home page but let's say Joe's spam blog that
is not going to be particularly helpful for you and it actually in some cases could hurt you so when you're going out and doing link building make sure that
you can stand behind the source of the link that is coming at you this could be in a good example from like a government website where it's trusted and a bad
example this could be from a website that you would not normally go to even on your own in addition to that there's different
kinds of links depending on the direction that they're going so if a link is coming towards you towards your website that's called an inbound link
these are the ones that are very helpful for popularity metrics that we've talked about there's also outbound links these are
links that you linking to other people now generally there's a big misconception about this that you'd
think you would not want to link out to other people but if you just follow the natural Channel events and you look at people who are writing blogs without SEO
in mind you'll see that they are linking out naturally and it's these natural patterns that search engines are looking for so there's absolutely no problem in
linking out just as long as it's two sources that you actually do trust so there's inbound links there's outbound
links there's links that have a lot of popularity value so like from an established Government website or from something popular like CNN there's also
links that are inbound that are not going to have as much value for you that you probably don't want to spend your time building now regardless of where
your links are coming from it's important to look out for one particular attribute it's called Rel nofollow Rel
no follow was a tool that was originally developed to combat comment spam like on blogs you'd have lots of people who are
leaving completely irrelevant comments so they can link back to their own website and get credit for that that does not work
at all today one of the primary reasons for that is the search engine introduced something called Rel nofollow where they
said here's a link that's going out for my website but I do not stand behind it and it does not pass any credit a lot of
times when you're doing leak building you'll get a link which you're very proud of coming from somewhere very popular but then realize that it has
this attribute attached to it no follow and which means you will not get any credit for it so make sure that when
you're doing your leak building the link coming at you that you've earned does not have this attribute associated with
it otherwise you will get no credit for it now that you understand what nofollow is let's let's talk about the biggest
use case for this social media most of the links that we see in social media are valueless this is because they're
either hidden from search engines entirely this mostly happens on Facebook or they're visible to search engines but
they use this row this Rel nofollow attribute which means that they're useless so while social media does have many many benefits SEO and particularly
link value from SEO is not one of the direct benefits of participating in social media now that we've covered some
of the link building dues let's talk about some of the link building don'ts so these are things that you should not do because you'll be wasting your time
Link Building Don'ts
and possibly more importantly your money the first one is Spam so we have all seen this online when you go somewhere
and you see just a bunch of spammy links links that are clearly written only for machines only for search engines a lot
of times these will have the name of pharmaceutical drugs on them a lot of times they'll have um just can be completely irrelevant to the content
while these have worked in some instances they are certainly not a best practice and they are certainly not a
long-term strategy so I never recommend trying to invest in spammy links this way because it's not going to ultimately
help you in fact in many ways it'll probably hurt you so do not go out of your way to try to get spammy links
the next one is buying links this is these are toes closely tied together now buying links is when you go out and try
to buy sometimes relevant sometimes irrelevant links and again this is something that had it worked sometimes
historically not always my biggest problem with this is not so much the ethical problem although there is one
there the search engines have clearly said not to ever do this my biggest problem with it is that you could not
calculate an accurate Roi on this so if you spend a dollar on this you don't know if you're gonna make a dollar or two dollars back you have no idea
there's no way to accurately measure this so you have no idea if this if this is valuable to you or not
where as opposed to if you're creating valuable content you can measure that and you can directly tie it to Sales so
your your money dollar for dollar is spent much much more effectively on content than it is on buying links so I
highly recommend do not spend your time or your money buying links the last one is acquiring reciprocal
links so reciprocal links as you can imagine are links that go in a circle you link to somebody and they link directly back to you now in the natural
web when no marketing is taking new place into this there's no kind of manipulation trying to go on that happens that happens all the time so
don't go out of your way and be afraid of this happening so one new site will very regularly link to another news article and that article might link back
to them somewhere else that happens so don't stress about this too much but don't go out of your way to try to build
all of your links in a reciprocal way we're overthinking this by trying to link to somebody else who links to a third party that third party links to
you don't waste your time this is just not a factor that you should worry about reciprocal links are not generally as
good as one-way links but it happens so often that is not is not worthy of your time or any kind of investment trying to
avoid this the concept of linking is foundational to good rankings and understanding the
internet at Large it starts with the premise that good content will be cited by others
recommending it to other people how we cite and recommend information online is by linking to it
we link to information that we find valuable based on that the search engines assess
content by how websites link to one another so we are going to cover the definition
How to Build Backlinks?
and purpose of links and the different functions that links serve
we'll also look at how links mirror human judgment we'll look at how search engines
evaluate links by mirroring human judgment and how that affects what's called Block
Level analysis and how where the location of different links and how they are used will greatly
affect their relevance we're going to look at how visitors from different link sources will behave
differently based on where they came from and also how you can measure the
effectiveness of links and finally we're going to look at both good and bad linking practices now links serve a
number of purposes from a functional standpoint they usually are our primary means of
navigation online we click on links we go to different pages and from those
pages we find links to other pages links are also a method of citing other
content when we quote somebody when we use information that we have found somewhere
else we cite that information to give credit to the original author typically
online we do that with a link so that if someone wants to see the original Source
document it's available to them that also helps to provide credibility to you
credibility to the author of the original source as well as assigning importance to the knowledge that came
from that original source and the authority of the original source links also provide us with a clear
structure of how our websites are built how the pages relate to one another and
how organized the information can be so let's break down the functional part
of a link this is important if you're going to be developing anchor text and linking to
understand the structure the ahref equals is the start of the
link tag what you are doing is developing the reference of where the document is
contained that's the href reference is what it is short for
what comes next within the quotes is the location of the document now this can be
a full URL or you may just be linking to a document that's on the main root level
of your server this is the full location where you can access the document
and so you're putting the name of the document the extension so that it will be linked
the next part is what I have in caps you'll notice off to the left I have
something in all blue text and underlined which most people will recognize as a link
you see when it is in between the document location
and the closing of the link tag the text you have in there is what's called anchor text
you see instead of publishing the document location and the full URL of
the document we can put the link within text and
create anchor text so all someone has to do is click on the link and the document loads for them
this anchor text is vitally important to understanding how we can add additional
relevance to linking content then we see the closure of the link tag
this is what makes the internet the internet is millions of pages connected
together by Links so when we look at the functional side
of links and we look at this example here as you can see the title of this article is not the URL address of the
article it's a title and the title is the link that is the anchor text of the link
and so from a search engine standpoint search engines look to see what words
are being used in the link and how relevant those words are to the document
that is being linked it also looks to see where is the link
is it in the editorial information in the article is it part of the navigation
is it in a sidebar or is it an ad and then also search engines are looking
to see if this is a text link or an image link how long has that link been there
what type of link is it does it go somewhere within your website does it go
to another website or is it a reciprocal link which I will explain more later
they also look to see the text in the link and the context to the page with
the link directs you to we utilize links a little differently
you see from a human standpoint whenever we refer information to another person
when we provide reference material to another person or even if someone asks us for a recommendation we provide this
information you see offline we mirror the same behavior as we do online when we link
people ask us for information and we provide it we just mirror that online by making a
link offline we recommend we refer we provide
information to each other in much the same way the way I want you to think about it from a human standpoint is that
if you asked another person for advice or directions or a referral
are there certain people that you would trust more than others I'm sure the answer to that is yes and
maybe you have some people in mind that you are thinking about you see we run across the same issue
with search the search engines know that there are some websites that are much more
trustworthy than others just like if you were to ask someone for
information I'm sure you would ask the right person for the information you would ask the
most knowledgeable trustworthy person you knew who had Authority in that subject area
the search engines are trying to do the same thing with the links that we publish on our websites they're trying
to determine who is the most trustworthy and relevant based on the
recommendations referrals and citations of other websites to other websites
who are the websites that are trusted that are authorities the search engines are trying to do from
a technical algorithmic standpoint what we do naturally from a human standpoint
now from The Human Side as I had said before we need to think of links as information that we receive from other
people Word of Mouth advice information directions recommendations this is where
we need to think about links not from the standpoint of building false relevance for a search engine but being
a helpful resource for our readers how can we help them how can we provide
information and how can we be a credible source of information
how can we develop our Authority within the industry and so that people who have
questions about this content will see our websites as authoritative and
credible resources the best way to develop links as you'll see is good content when people like
what they read when they like what they see when they are willing to recommend it to others it's because you have
created something of value and they'll link to you when they feel
that you are credible and that you are authoritative with this
information only then will they share it with other people because you have earned that right for
them to share it with others by providing content that is informative educational
entertaining and you've provided that service only then will people then want
to recommend it to others by linking to it now links serve a number of benefits
When I look at some of the incoming links to my site one of the things I notice is that if I get a link in
certain places that can drive a lot of brand exposure I can have thousands of
people coming to the site looking to see an article and that provides a lot of
exposure to a lot of people however also getting a link from a
certain website especially if it's a high relevant authoritative website I
can see my rankings increase because of that but then also a good link is going to
drive people that will convert and drive sales or leads those who become
customers so those are the three aspects of a good link a good link will drive traffic to
your site a good link will assist your rankings and a good link will bring in business
if you can get a link to do all three of those at the same time that's what I call the golden link because it has all
three benefits usually however you're going to find that different links will provide
different types of benefits one of these three or maybe two out of these three
one of the things I'm usually very focused on is the link that drives sales
or generates leads that's getting links in the right place that will benefit me
tangibly rather than just getting thousands of people to see it
why it benefits me financially if I can get a link in the right place
so from here let's break down the different types of links we have navigational links we see these in our
navigation our primary navigation maybe the footer of our web pages where we
have links to typical information such as about us or contact us
we also have sidebar links this might be related information or offers or calls
to action and then also I would break it down into outbound or inbound type of navigation
outbound are links going to other websites inbound links are links that
come from other websites and that also I might send to other pages on my own site
now I've used the term editorial an editorial link is a link that is found
within the content of the website and by that I mean through an article
so if I am writing an article and I link to someone else and cite them or
reference them that is what's called an editorial link
it means that it's part of the content a great example of this is that the
navigation on your web pages is not part of the content it serves a function as navigation
but it doesn't have anything to do with supporting information with citing and
Authority so information and links that you put within the content and presented content
of your site are considered editorial now there's also a call to action links
where you're bringing someone to a landing page or a registration page or a sale page
then also we have Social Links now these can provide a variety of means but
typically a social link will go to a profile maybe it's a username that takes you
somewhere else or comment or maybe just an image or something that goes to a
social site or that you have placed on your own site as well either way it's all contained within
that social network even though the links are going on and off your site they tend to be controlled in that
social environment now I've used the term reciprocal link now this is
something very specific a reciprocal link is one where you would
go to somebody else and you would make a trade such as if you link to me I'll
link to you and maybe you put those links on the home page or maybe you create a page just for that link
you see sometimes it just doesn't make sense and so the search engines will see
that you've linked to each other but if there's no contextual relevance if
there's no contextual relevance most likely you won't get any benefit because you've agreed to link to each
other for the primary purpose of boosting rankings now this is not to say that two websites can't link to each
other because there is some relevance we'll look at some examples of that
later on in this module also then we have advertising links these can be ads banners anything on the
page that is an advertising link that if you were to click on it you would go to that advertisers page
those links are typically through an ad server and they take place in entirely
different ecosystem but they are links and we need to know
what kind of links are advertising and which kind of links are functional to
our websites now when I broke down the different types of links so we have our navigation
links we have links in our sidebar and in our footer with Block Level analysis
does is that the search engines look at the code of the page they break down the page because it's
very easy to figure out which part of the code has to do with your navigation which part of the code has to do with
your sidebar and your footer and which part of the code is calling ads from an ad server what this leaves is the
editorial content your article and the ability of search engines then to break
down your page into these different elements the reason why they do it is that the links contained in the
editorial space are considered to be more relevant in terms of linking to
other websites than any of the other types of links on your web page search
engines don't consider all parts of the page to be equally relevant which is okay because neither do humans we look
at the navigation as utilization pure utility because it's just helping me
navigate among the different pages of your website I'm not expecting to learn anything I'm using it as a functional
means of navigating your site now your sidebar might have some calls to action it might have links to other pages but
it's not an article it's what you've developed and so it might be a little more important than your navigation but
it's not as important as what you may have written within content your footer navigation is basically the same you
control that it's the same on every page and so what the search engines are looking for are the unique content the
unique article or information that you've published and if there is a link within the editorial content that is
highly relevant because it has to do with content it has to do with information that you are sharing and so
the links there are going to be more highly relevant and are going to be more important for the search engines to see
you see it's the same way with humans we're not going to look at navigation to
learn something it's functional the same thing with the footer and as humans we're reading the content that you have
in your article and if you link to another source well you've provided us with utility but it's contextual utility
because you're citing where you found information or you're citing an
additional Source or you are linking to an example and it enables me as a human
to see that understand it and if I need that additional information I can click
on it and go to it so I'm going to look at the information on the page in that article very
differently that I'm going to look at the headings the navigation the sidebars
or the footer because the article is what is informing me and so the links in
the article I'm going to look at very differently and hold them in a higher level of relevance
now over time search engines have had to refine the algorithm about links
you see in the early days of search engine algorithms they used to Simply count the amount of links than if one
site had more links than another that made it more credible however once people started to figure
that out people started accumulating links by really any means necessary
and they were just looking for the sheer volume of links because they knew if
they got the most amount of links it would affect their rankings and so over the years the search engines
have had to change and adjust and add more relevance to their algorithm
refine it in order to look at different aspects of links in order to properly determine relevance
so over time it wasn't just having a link it was then also looking at how
many people cite this site as an authority so looking at the source of
the link and the types of pages then also looking at the text of the link and matching it with the text of
the page does it match is it contextual and then looking at the type of Link
doing the Block Level analysis and then also the context the relevancy
of your site compared to the linking site compared to the link and the
information that's being shared there also some of the ways that they can look at it are the age of the link how long
has that link been there humans do the same thing when we look to see how long someone has been in
business we're looking at credibility and then of course there are many many other ongoing refinements that are going
into the search engines evaluations of links sometimes the age of the link isn't as relevant especially when you're
looking for something that has happened very recently an Old Link could mean that it's old
news or that something has changed since then so search engines are in a constant
battle to ensure that people are not gaming the system
by falsely creating relevance through linking the link relevancy and the algorithm is
all about trying to determine who is the most relevant and credible within this
area and that is the focus of most search engine algorithm refinements over the
past few years and it will be into the future now this is where I'm going to start bringing in some screenshots from a link
Management program as a search engine Optimizer a link Management program is probably going to
be one of your best friends as you move along in this industry in this example this program link Decks
that I'm using will track the incoming links to my website and it'll also
provide a breakdown as to what type of website those links are coming from so I
can see how many links I have from blogs how many links I have from news sites how many links from wikis how many links
from directories forums social media public relations sites articles or
additional resources then I can also add my competitors and I
can compare where I stand in terms of the amount of links from each source and
where my competitors stand in this way I can be sure that we all have a similar link profile you see if
my linking profile looks vastly different than all my competitors the search engines are going to see that as
well and know that something might be different with me good or bad and that's
going to raise a red flag so I want to look at the linking profile because every industry and
almost every business is linking profile is going to be a little different but especially among Industries we see that
linking profiles that is the amount of links from different sources it's going to be slightly different for every
different type of industry or business so this helps me understand where my
links are coming from which is vitally important because from a business standpoint one thing that I've tracked
consistently in analytics is that people will act differently and also I can
predict which source is going to send me the best customers
you see just because someone comes from a link doesn't mean they're going to buy or become a customer or really become a
lead many times they're going to come look at your information and leave
and based on how they come to your site whether it's through a Blog a directory
a forum or a new site has a lot to do with how they view your website
and it's all about the context you see this is what I've learned over the years is that people will behave
differently based on how they find the website what I found is that people from blogs
news sites and articles they tend to stay longer do more and have a higher
chance of conversion of becoming a customer or a lead
the main reason is because blogs and articles they have a lot of context it's
an article someone has taken the time to write some information out and then link to my site which means there is a highly
contextual reason for someone to click that link also what it means is that there's a lot
less competition for that link when my link is in that article
compare that with social news or any type of social site you see when you're on a social site and
you're looking at your social stream of information there's a lot of different people competing for your attention a
lot of different things and it's not just in one subject area it's usually from multiple subject areas and so the
context is very low because there's a lot of different types of information and the competition for your attention
is very high because of that people from social sites or applications
tend to visit more often but they only tend to view one page and leave
immediately because they're looking to see what was interesting and then they move on to the
next subject that's the difference between how people react based on where they come from
and so when I'm measuring links I'm looking to see which links do I have
what's the source and then how do those sources behave differently from one
another and why you see if I find that I'm getting links from sources that people are staying
longer doing more and converting at a higher rate then I'm going to continue to focus on building links in those
areas because it directly affects how I monetize my website
so here's a strategy in building links one of the things I'm looking at is the
source of links like I said if I can find a link Source that's providing
visitors that will stay look at my content engage with the content and eventually convert and convert at a
higher rate than other sources of content or visitors then I'm going to focus on that source
and so I'm going to look at some high Authority websites whether they're industry Publications news sites
education sites those are what are considered high Authority blogs articles news sites
that's what I'm looking to do I want to find the most authoritative website and sometimes it happens naturally if
people that work at those websites or manage those sites if they find you and they like your content they'll link to
it and that way you can get more credibility more relevancy
certain people certain organizations certain websites have more Authority influence than others it goes back to
the question that I asked you early in this module that how do you know if someone is more authoritative than
somebody else we also have mid Authority websites which you can get some links on and low
Authority websites which are very easy to get links but here's what I've learned when it comes to link building
one link from one high quality website can be worth hundreds or thousands of
mid to low quality links ultimately it's about quality not
quantity one of the things that I will do utilizing my link software is look at
the context of the link I want to see how relevant this is so as I said if I want to find a high relevant
website what I'm looking for in terms of this is I want to see the influence of
the domain as well as the relevance of the domain those are two factors that
we're going to look at when we're evaluating the quality of a domain now
as I'm looking at this report here what influence means is that it is a high
quality website that within the linking algorithm these sites have a lot of
authority however they may not be relevant
so for example they may have a lot of sites attributing authority to them
but they may not be relevant to my industry which is why we have the next column of keyword relevance
you see when I'm evaluating my links I'm looking for the sources that are both
influential and relevant that means that I've got a link from a
site that fits the two standards of high Authority it's authoritative and
relevant now it's good to have links from authoritative sites that might not be relevant
it's still authoritative however to get the full benefit I want
it to be influential and relevant but not to say that I'm not looking for
links from these other sources this is just a means of measuring what you have as well as comparing it to your
competitors and other websites now here's some best practices when I'm
optimizing anchor text I want to maintain contextual relevance so I want
to use text in the text link and I want to explain to people what they're
linking to what they're going to find when they click on that link if I use an
image as a link I'm going to use an ALT attribute because if that image doesn't show up that ultrabute
is necessary to let people know where to go but also I do get a little tiny bit of
benefit by using that alt attribute within the image link I also want to look at the relevance of
the source page that I'm linking to and make sure contextually the link the link text and the content of the page is
contextually relevant to the destination page I also want to be sure that I don't
overuse the keywords that I don't make multiple links to the same destination
that I don't use the same anchor text over and over I can be downgraded or even penalized by
the search engine algorithm if that is found on my pages so as an example instead of using click
here for a how-to article I might use the exact phrase of how to
fix whatever it is and use that as the link to the page that has the content
that's a simple way of looking at anchor text am I directing someone to
additional information if I am then how can I present it to them so they know
exactly what they're going to find and Link it appropriately
I look at it as developing the next step for your readers where do you want them
to go what do you want them to do what resources do you have available to them how can you structure them so that
they're easily understood and you're explaining the Final Destination
like I said if you overuse anchor text you can be downgraded or penalized by
the search engines so what I will tell you to do is number one avoid overstuffing anchor content
that means needlessly repeating keywords in the anchor text don't do that
avoid being redundant meaning don't have four or five or six links with the same
anchor text going to the same page that's a clear way of letting search engines know that you're going overboard
don't just randomly Place links throughout your text just to get the link
ask yourself are you really helping the reader find the information they need
and do it once and then also avoid extremely overly
promotional words within the linked text such as best expert cheap number one
those types of things so a couple examples we can say for travel advice click here but I would say
here is my travel advice and Link travel advice rewrite it be creative
if it were easy everyone would be doing it but this is where you can write things
in a better way to get the attention of the reader and position it as a resource
also utilizing your url as the link or as the anchor text as well for the link
in order to get that click as I've got it here I would not
recommend that you use that I would recommend that you avoid that also the third line the check out the
best website for iPhones and iPhone accessories utilizing overly promotional words is one of those ways that you can
easily get caught by the search engines now for future considerations when it
comes to Links realize that the majority of algorithm changes are link based
evaluation refinements because people are constantly attempting to fool the search engines and develop a false link
profile you should work to create high quality
links with high quality content I wouldn't chase after Poor or low
quality links
now as I've mentioned before there are a number of tools available for you to
manage and measure your backlinks tools such as link decks Moz Raven Advanced
Link manager Majestic SEO and then also you can use your Google analytics as
well however Google analytics only shows you the visitors that have come from
links and what they've done the basic functions of Link management software and there are many other types other
than what are listed here but the first thing that it does is just provide a catalog of incoming links from
other domains to your site and your competitor sites they offer tools for
comparison to see which domains are linking to you what type of link it is and on which Pages those links are
listed they'll also report newly acquired links in the past 30 60 90 days
or something similar to that the purpose of Link management software is to help you assess high quality domains versus
low quality domains in terms of importance and relevance
like I said the first job of a link management tool is to collect all of
your backlinks you add your domain and the tools will usually spider the domain
they'll go out into search engines and go out into many other formats in order to find and retrace who is linking to
you what page that link is contained sometimes what text is on that page and
what text is being used in the link they will catalog all of your incoming links organize them format them and report
back to you most of these link programs provide additional filters and management tools so that you can get
more insights about who is linking to you how they are linking to you and the
type of site personally I use Link decks in order to Monitor and report on my backlinking so
the first report here that I'm showing out of Link decks is that I see the total amount of incoming links to my
domain this says I have over 2 000 links and those 2 000 links are on about 1 000
domains on average it looks like I have about two links from every domain that
is linking to me so this is one way that you start to look at your links number
one the total amount of domains that are linking to you and then the total amount
of links available this way you can isolate domains that are linking to you consistently and also find those that
may not be the best domains or that are sending a lot of links that are just not
relevant the next thing I do in analyzing My Links is to look at the type of Link
meaning the type of site that it's coming from this report breaks down the amount of
links coming from blogs news sites directories forums social sites articles
or resources now it doesn't usually get all of those links but it does get
enough to give you an idea of how well you're doing in each channel one of the
things that I do like about this report is it also has a timeline so I can look and see when new links have been
acquired and maybe when some links have been just disappeared that's called
churn and it's normal it's normal because many times a link is published on social media and it kind of just goes
away or it's not tracked anymore by your link management software it can't find
it anymore and so linking is always Dynamic you are always gaining new links
and losing old links there's going to be a normal amount of churn
the next report shows me all of the domains that are linking to me it also shows me in the next column how many of
those domains are also linking to at least one competitor and it will list as many competitors as I have listed in
here if they list to multiple competitors it would let me know the influence of
that site or the authority that site is seen because of the amount of websites
and credibility that Authority has for that domain it'll also let me know the keyword relevance how relevant that
website is overall contextually to my domain and the content that I have
it will also let me know how many pages on that domain have links to my website
so I can also go through and I can filter this list by the type of site I
can filter by those domains that are using anchor text to see how much anchor
text is being used and what type of anchor text there are many different ways that you can filter through all of
the domains that are linking to you in order to get an idea of what's happening
on your domain what are competitors doing and also the relevance of those
links to your site now when I say that I can add competitors this is another type of
report very similar to the one I showed earlier where I look at my own standing in the different types of sources of
links such as blogs directories forums and so on I can also when I add my
competitors look to see how they are performing in those different areas as
well and so I can compare my link profile to my competitors
different Industries are going to have different backlink profiles they might be more heavily weighted towards blogs
or they might be more heavily weighted towards forums or social sites in this
way I can look to see if my competitors are actively link building and how
they're going about it I can see where maybe they are excelling in one area that the rest of the competitors are not
so I can compare different strategies I can also compare different timelines to
see if I am acquiring Links at a faster rate than my competitors this is very important if you are a newer business or
a newer website trying to compete now specifically what I can do is look
at an individual domain in this case this domain has three pages linking to
me and that domain also links to two of my competitors I can look at the
specific pages and what I'm looking at here are Snippets this should be familiar to you because what it's
showing is the URL of the page that's linking to my page it shows me the page
title of that page and then in this report it lets me know if there are any
keywords being used in the link in the anchor text as well as the number of
links from that page now what this tells me is that this is most likely a
directory something that is listing all the different places that where you can buy products because it's most likely
the linking to the domain name seeing that there are no keywords being used in
Anchor text and also that there are 16 out about links from that page that
means that it must be a list of some sort and they are linking not only to me but most likely to competitors as well
so I can track my Links at the Domain level and at the page level I can look
to see which Pages might have more influence or relevance to my content I
can also see the link URL the page title if any keywords are being used in the
anchor text and also within the context of how many additional links are leaving
from that page if there are a high amount of outgoing links on that page then a link from that page might not be
as valuable since there are so many links the less links there are coming out from that page the more it will
benefit my site because I'm getting more benefit from less links
now also what I'm going to do is compare the link reports to my analytics I'm going to go to my analytics because
linking software does not show traffic it doesn't show how many people are
clicking on the link it only shows who's linking to you but it does not show visitor activity analytics will show you
visitor activity to see which domains are most effective in sending visitors
to your site if you'll go back to the primary benefits of linking visitors
branding and business analytics show me visitors and business it shows me which
domains are sending me visitors and which of those visitors are becoming customers
so what I can do is go to Google analytics look at all the domains that
are referring traffic to my site I can also click on the domain and see the
destination page that they are linking to I can see how many visitors are coming either monthly or annually how
often they're coming back whether they're new users or repeat users how long they stay how many pages they View
and how many conversions as a result of those visits this is a great way to get
a 360 degree view of your linking because not only do you want links that
will help you rank better you also want links that will send business and customers to you as well
building links can take many forms ideally it is through networks relationships and marketing that other
websites and users learn about you like you and recommend you to others
unfortunately there is a lot of bad outdated and untrustworthy advice to be
found about building links to your website in this section I'll present the best
practices as accepted by the omcp standard the objectives for this module that
you'll be able to develop a link building strategy that you'll understand the value of
different link types finally you'll be able to find inbound link opportunities
first step in building links is to evaluate what you have
now there are many tools available that you can utilize to do this for you there
are automated tools that you can get that will catalog all of the incoming
links to your website some of them are link decks Moz Raven or
Advanced Link manager there are many that can do that you may also want to
utilize your analytics as well in order to find websites that link to you
the first step is evaluating where you are right now
your incoming links have a significant impact on your rankings and you can do a lot of on-page
optimization and see some results however a lot of Google's algorithm
takes into account links from other high quality websites
now when you evaluate what you have in this example I'm showing you a screenshot from link decks
link decks catalogs the incoming links to my website and it groups them into
different areas the first way it groups them is by high value or high influence domains
those are websites that link to me that have a lot of influence not necessarily
in my industry but High influence based on the amount of people that link to
them as an authority on many different subjects the next way that it groups that is
based on relevance now this is when it looks at the match
of my content versus the content of the other website in the first example we can see the
National Library of Medicine it is a high influence website because
it is a government website with a lot of information that is cited frequently
because of the amount of other websites linking to that site it has a high
amount of influence now based on the website that I am measuring
there is a lot of keyword relevance meaning that that National Library of
Medicine site with the government has a lot of content that's very similar to my site a lot of the same keywords are
being used so not only is this website of high influence it also has a lot of relevance
and that's key when evaluating my backlinks I want to look at which websites are
also referring traffic so while I may have a link from the National Library of Medicine I want to
look at my analytics and look to see is it also providing visitors our visitors
following that link to my site and I also want to look at the quality of traffic that it produces
do these visitors stay longer than average do they convert more than average I want
to look at the quality of traffic based on the source next I want to look at the incoming
links from those other websites number one I want to make sure that the incoming link from the other site is
both accurate and relevant meaning the text that is used in the link is it
accurate to the content that will appear on the page when the visitor clicks that
link is the content relevant this is especially relevant if I have updated my
website changed the content or moved things around I want to be sure that that incoming
link sends visitors to the appropriate page and the appropriate information
I also want to ensure that that link is worded correctly that it uses the right
words that is sending visitors and setting expectations of the content that
they will see I may need to contact the website manager or owner and maybe ask for a
better linked text or a more accurate page destination
now this requires some interaction with the owner or manager of another website
and you always want to be respectful of their time and not demanding that they
make any changes in some cases the organization may be so big you may never find the right person
in order to optimize the text or the destination of that link
you always want to look for accuracy in cases where your company or website name
is utilized in the link but also if there is any contact information such as address phone number
a description of your business and any content make sure it's accurate and it all
points to the right place another way to look for links is to Simply go to a search engine and start
doing searches search for your company your business your company name and look for websites
that may mention you but do not have a live link to your website
many times your company will be mentioned or cited but there will not be a live link you can only find these
through doing searches and seeing which websites mention you without linking to
you now this could be an opportunity to get an Easy Link especially if you can find
some contact information and finding the right person that could add a link to
your company information again you'll need to be polite ask for their help and it will help it if you
can develop the link along with the link text and send that over
giving them just a quick and easy edit to be able to add the information
so make it as easy as possible as an example I've provided a sample
request format again you want to be polite you want to
be inviting and respectful of their time and their management
sometimes like I said you may find the right person that can help you however the larger the company the more
difficult it will be to make this happen this just requires your patience
and again being polite and not expecting the company to do what you are asking
many times this is just a formality and sometimes companies will act on it so be
sure to approach this with the right expectations the next thing I want to look at are
business listings these are the easy ways to establish links and ensure that
links are where they should be and also opportunities
look for business directories especially if your company has a local presence
you can utilize Chamber of Commerce lists Association lists or local
listings if they are on websites see if they offer links that can go to your website
rather than just the list of businesses that are in the area even on a larger level you can look for
associations directories or listings where you can add your business or
double check if your business is there and always ensure that your business
name address phone number and URL are correct complete and consistent with
other listings the next level will require some active
marketing and that's where you search for opportunities you can go out and look for other
resource lists within your industry or directories of businesses within your
industry and you can get a link many times through membership or submitting
your business as a resource however you may want to step up your marketing you can do that by
interviewing your clients seeing if they might be willing to provide a testimonial and a link to your website
you may also want to go out and find other communities online maybe some social communities that are relevant to
your industry get involved with those communities fill out a profile and get involved by
contributing information by sharing information you'll find that people like getting information and
they'll respond by linking to your site another option is to utilize the tool
that you had for indexing your links from the first step you can also add your competitors and you can look at
their backlinks you can look and see which websites and which domains are linking to your
competitors but you always need to go and see why what are those other sites
linking to and what is the nature of that link sometimes it may exclude you from being
able to approach competitors backlinks and ask them for links
however if they're being linked to by companies that are simply stating here
are vendors in this space and they are linking your competitors and you're not there
then it might make a lot of sense for you to approach and ask if you can be listed as well
however be sure that the links to your competitors are not from a consumer or
customer relationship in that case it might be out of line for you to ask for a link
make sure if you approach anyone who's linking to a competitor and asking for a
link to your site make sure the context is right and that it makes sense for them
and that's the ultimate judge of value does it benefit somebody else to link to
your site we all know that it will benefit you but when you present your link request you
need to offer value and the benefit for others to link to you
so be sure that you present it in a way that is beneficial and good for those people that will be
adding the link they're the ones that have to take the work to do it and they're also the ones that are adding a
recommendation for you and your business so as always you need to be considerate
and patient now the best way to build links is by
creating something that people like and sharing it you see the best way to build links is
by creating value through content or information or entertainment
you see when people like things they link to it if they find a study or a white paper or
research that you performed they link to it if you post a infographic that explains
something and it's attractive people link to it
you see that's what's most amazing about linking I find that when we put most of
our effort into creating content that people like that's what builds the most valuable and
the most relevant links and so what type of content well you can create infographics videos top 10 lists
or articles articles with advice or analysis of Market data or even research
that type of content people love it and so when you publish it out you utilize
social media to extend the reach and the visibility of that type of content
and when someone likes it they'll link to it and recommend it to others
now people also like depending upon your industry or your business they also like some personality maybe some humor
people always like expert information they like the cute this is why pictures
of cats tend to be liked and linked to more than almost anything else and also the unexpected
if you can inject any of that into your content that just makes it more valuable
more personable and again more shareable by other people and every time someone
shares it it builds a link to your site you see the best linking is when people
like something when you create something that people like and share you might be surprised at
the many opportunities there are to get links based on your content
I've seen many many blogs based on cooking fashion Arts Sports music
and when people specialize within a specific topic they always find an
audience and so anything they publish builds links even on certain social media sites such
as Pinterest people upload pictures on articles and
infographics especially about landscaping flowers food cars you name
it there is a special interest for anything and you can develop links from
those social sites to your site and it can generate traffic
even with a Blog developing articles that talk about upcoming events new
music Sports whatever it is when you create content that people like
it takes the longest amount of time to build content for building links when
you develop your own content that's the biggest investment you'll make in time
and research and writing and presentation however the result is that when you develop that
content you will receive the best and highest quality links and the most valuable
links are going to be to that content as I mentioned before one high quality
link can be worth more than hundreds or thousands of low quality links so my
best advice is to create content that people like that they link to
and that will be high value links that you'll generate to your site focus in on
Google Algorithms
so let's talk then now about how the Google algorithms work so we'll shift
gears here and we'll talk about how these algorithms work on Google so Google uses advanced concepts retrieve
data so what they do is they're spidering they're spidering they're collecting web pages and they're taking
all these web pages back to their server and anytime somebody does a query they're delivering those web pages
within milliseconds they're delivering results based on your query so that's in
general how it works so it uses a combination of different algorithms to deliver the best results they want the
best results and so some of the most popular algorithms below are Google
Panda Google penguin and Google rank brain so these are all things that
Google has done and to make sure that they're constantly tweaking their search engine is to deliver the best results so
let's talk about some of these these popular algorithms and before we talk about these popular algorithms let's
just make one thing clear that Google's always tweaking their algorithms on
their search engine and so if you want to get an idea how often they do it well they do it every day they're constantly
tweaking it but what they do is they release major changes to their algorithm a few times a year so if you want to get
a sense of what those changes look like well you could go to moz.com and you can
go to Google Dash algorithm Dash change and you can see here that hey Google
changes the search algorithm around 500 to 600 times while most of these are
minor Google again rolls out major changes like Panda like penguin that
affects search results in significant ways so you can go here and you can go all the way back to 2000 and see some of
the algorithm of them changes that have occurred over the last few years and you
can see here the last major one was done in August of 2018 that was the medic
core update so they're constantly making changes to their search engine to
deliver a more concise more better ecosystem for the end user so if it's a
better search engine for the end user end users are going to come back so the whole idea is continuing to tweak the
system that the algorithms to better show more accurate results and so let's
take a look at some of the the major algorithm changes that they've done in the past so the first is we'll talk
about Google Panda and Panda was an algorithm released back in 2011. so here
Google Panda
we are in 2019 is a few years ago but still significant in that really this
algorithm emphasized high quality content because before Panda there was a
there's just a lot of content out there on the internet and there was a lot of
spam content there are a lot of duplicate content and so really the idea behind panda is for Google to really
deliver in their search engine results Pages high quality content so what it did was it removed web pages that had
low quality or duplicate content so that was the whole idea behind you know the algorithm nickname Panda it removed low
quality and duplicate content and that kind of cleaned things up a bit where if you did a search query now you'd
actually see better better results and one thing about panda is because there's
so much quality because Google's indexing so much there on the internet that it's constantly being updated it's
updated regularly so the next one we're going to talk about is Google penguin so penguin was released after Panda and
Google Penguin
with that focused in on was low quality links so remember we talked about link
building we talk about quality links over quantity so naturally you're going
to have links naturally from all websites whether that be high quality or
low quality the whole idea behind this algorithm is to sever the links that are
low quality and so the idea behind that was they focused on two areas so they
focused in on Links games and keyword stuffing so that's what penguin focused on was link schemes were basically link
almost link farming where you produced Mass amounts of backlinks and not all of
them were good quality they weren't natural links links should be natural from one high quality site or blog to
another high quality cider blog and by creating lengths games you've created an ecosystem where links just went to
irrelevant low quality spam related pages and so Google's Penguins algorithm
update focused in on that effort to remove or combat pages that had poor
links from being indexed in their search engine results and then they also combated keyword stuffing keyword
stuffing is nothing more than taking your targeted keyword and stuffing it into the content of your page or title
tag your meta description so any sites that were caught up doing that basically suffer the consequences because what
penguin did was take care of sites that basically were accused of keyword
stuffing or had characteristics of keyword stuffing and they removed sites
that had a lot of links pointing to it from poor quality sites and vice versa sites that really had a lot of external
links pointing to other poor quality sites so that's what penguin did they took a look at those two areas and so we
talk about link schemes again penguin's aim was to decrease the ranking of web pages that created artificially by using
black hat techniques and basically what I mean by black hat techniques that artificially creating length that just
didn't make sense just for the sake of getting the backlink just for the sake of passing link juice and so that's what
a link scheme is or was and so Google basically tweaked their algorithm to
combat those poor link schemes and so keyword stuffing as I mentioned a minute
ago it's just repetitive usage of the same keyword and that just basically
suffers the content is the thing that suffers here and when the content suffers the end users suffer so Google
is all about quality content and when you have quality content and that quality contents indexed and users find
what they're looking for chances are they're going to go back to the search engine to continue to find what they're looking for with the end result being
presented with quality content so keyword stuffing really dilutes the quality of the content and then let's
talk about the third algorithm which is rank brain so rank brain is a processing
algorithm that uses is machine learning and what that does that machine learning interprets search queries that users
RankBrain
search on Google so for example if rankbrain sees a word or phrase it isn't
familiar with basically the machine can make a guess as to what words or phrases
might have a similar meaning and filter the result accordingly so basically take
these search engine queries and present them in a way that's logical so that the
end result can be something that's relevant to what you're looking for and so for example if you're searching for
online marketing you will get results related for digital marketing on search engine real Pages why because rankbrain
will interpret that particular keyword and they're trying to basically match based on all the data they collected
what words or phrases might have a similar meaning so online marketing digital marketing have similar meanings
Google Search Console

video you will surely able to answer this question so let's get started by
knowing how search console works to understand the working of search console it is necessary to have a
detailed knowledge about how search engine works search engines mainly Works
in three steps crawling indexing and ranking let's have a look at each step
one by one so first let's start with crawling search engines are hungry for content
and so they send Web spiders or web crawlers also known as robots or search
engine Bots to discover new content or any updated content
content can be an image a web page a video or anything else present on the
web this process is known as crawling now let's know about indexing
as soon as the crawler discovered the updated content or new content
these web crawlers start storing the URLs of the content into the search
index or web Index this process is known as indexing once the content is indexed
it starts appearing in the search result pages when a user enters a search query the
most relevant results are taken from the index and displayed in the form of most
relevant to least relevant in the search result Pages this process is known as
ranking now that we have gained knowledge about how search engine works
here I have a question for you choose the correct option with respect
to working of search engines you need to choose the option for all
the steps of how search engines work option A indexing crawling ranking
option b ranking indexing crawling option C crawling indexing ranking and
option D crawling ranking and indexing let us know your answer in the comment
section below now let's get started by learning how
search console actually works search console is a primary source of
information that helps search engine Bots to crawl index and rank the pages
of your website thereby allowing the website owners to
monitor the health of your website all you need to do is integrate search
console with your website and get the ownership allow the search engine Bots to crawl
your website and index the pages also don't forget to submit your website
sitemap to search engines submitting sitemaps helps the crawler to discover
more pages of your website thereby understanding your site's
architecture we will know how it is done in the upcoming part of the video
also you need to keep an eye on the errors suggested by search console and
solve them else it may harm the ranking of your website now let me remind you that all the
reports that are generated in search console are based on the activity of the
web Crawlers on your website now let's understand various parameters and
terminologies from search console to get a complete understanding of this
webmaster tool so without any further delay let's start
understanding the basic terminologies of Google search console and how they work
and improve your website's Health the first one we have is performance
reports Google search console provides two types of performance report search reports and
discover reports let's first understand about search reports
search reports help to analyze the search performance of your website
search performance reports include metrics and dimensions so let's first focus on metrics
here there are four types of metrics as you can see in this image the metrics
include the total clicks or I must say clicks Impressions average CTR and
average position Impressions provides the data on how
many times your websites appears in the search results as you can see here the graph shows the
number of times this website has appeared in the search results the next metric we have is clicks
clicks provide the data on the total number of times users clicked from the
search results and reached your website the graph below shows the number of
times the users have clicked from search results and they have arrived on any
page of my website so suppose if here is a number 200 so we can definitely get an
idea for very number of dates number of dates provided on the x-axis which shows that
how many times the user has clicked and arrived on the website and the number
various varies from between like 200 200 uh 250 300 and in between 250 to 300.
and the next metric we have is average CTR average CTR or click-through rate is
the percentage of Impressions that results in clicks in the same manner the graph below shows
or the average CTR for various different dates the next metric we have is average
position the average position represents the data about the average position of
the sites in the search results it is possible that your website is
ranking today at number one position so it may rank tomorrow at 3 some other day
at 4 some other day at 9 or 10 and again it may rank to the one so this data
actually provides the detail about the average position which your website
frequently ranks at so that is if it is ranking at one two and three in between
one two and three positions so the average position may be two now understanding about the dimensions
dimensions are the data attribute that defines who did something on your site
or from where here is the list of dimensions on which
the dimension performance reports are generated that is countries Pages queries devices search
appearance and dates the dimension country suggests the
country from which the search came as you can see here from the left column
you can get the list of number of countries from the right side you can get the idea about the clicks impression
ctrn position that is all the metrics related to that query uh from which the
search came from or from that location or whatever the activity has happened
from that location next we have is the dimensions Pages Pages show the pages
clicked by user or a page that is viewed on a search so this this actually you
get the reports from the search consoled in the form of the links where you get the link which is the exact page that is
viewed on the search if there exists duplicate pages on the site then only one canonical page or
canonical link will be displayed by the search engines out of the number of duplicate pages so basically canonical
links are those links uh like if there are suppose there is a one original page
and there are two three duplicate page of the same page so what happens uh the
original page gains the canonical link and uh this page has more value than the
duplicate pages so whenever the search engine will crawl your website or the duplicate pages may
be ignored and all its uh link juice or link Equity or anything will be
completely taken for the original page moving ahead to queries
queries provide the query string that users search on the Google search console
so Suppose there is a website it says suppose uh let's talk about the simply learn website so suppose a user may add
as Java course and simply learn websites appears at second or third position so
this query so suppose user clicks on the website and reaches the website this
query Java course on simply learn or Java course will add in the search
console showing that the user has reached to your website using this query
Java course and again all the list of the queries appears towards the left and
all the matrixes for that query like clicks impression CTR and its average
position is appeared towards the right in the search console now talking about
the search appearance search appearance helps in grouping the data as per the
search result type or by the feature so you can get here the number of search
appearance and again the same metrics as with respect back to the search appearance criteria next let's move
towards the dates groups of data as per the dates according to the public time zones now
let's have a look over the Discover performance report now here you must be thinking about how
the search is different from discover yes search and discover follow different
approaches users enter a query to find a required information with search
whereas discover shows the content based on what result will be best match for
your query as per the Google's automated system now coming to the Discover performance
report as per Google's guidelines discover performance reports are visible
only if your website has a minimum threshold of impressions in discover
now moving to another important parameter of search console which is URL
inspection URL inspection is an interesting tool in
the search console this tool allows you to inspect whether the URL is indexable
or not some main functions of this tool includes
checking the current status of the URL inspecting live URLs requesting indexing
for a URL viewing Pages rendered version viewing
crawl Pages viewing tested Pages Etc
in order to check the index status of URL open the URL inspection tool
and add the complete URL for which we need to know its indexing status
now to understand the results check the present status if it shows that URL is
on Google as you can see in the screen this means that URL qualifies Google's
criteria and is eligible to appear in search results if it shows URL is not on Google then
the URL does not qualify the Google's criteria and is not eligible to appear
in search results you can check more details like URL Discovery crawl and indexing information
from the page availability tab click on the crawl page to see the
information about the HTTP request and response if you find that the link is
disabled just hover over the page to check the reason now coming to the live URL test
it is helpful to test the live URL and check if it is capable of being indexed
it proves helpful when you update your page and want to compare it with its
latest indexed version just to bring it to your notice a life test will only confirm whether
the Google crawler can access your page for indexing but it doesn't assure that
your page will be included in the Google index altogether with the help of index
coverage report one can find the list of URLs which includes the URLs Google has
found on your website the URLs that have been indexed and identify if any
indexing problem have occurred next we move ahead to understand about the site
Maps the site map is the file that contains all the information of pages on your
website this helps search engine crawlers to crawl your website and understand your
website structure and helps them to index the pages more efficiently
more the crawler indexes your pages higher the chances for the pages of your
website to appear in the search results with the help of site maps you can
provide information about various contents like Pages videos images
Etc as you can understand a sitemap plays an important role in indexing
process you must be curious to know how we can create and submit a site map to search
engines before we understand this process make sure that all pages of your website are
linked in an appropriate manner with each other thereby maintaining a healthy
site structure a site map can be created in XML format RSS format or in text
format it can be Auto generated or created manually as well most commonly used
sitemap is XML following is an example of an XML site
map this is the simplest version of the sitemap that we are representing here
you can submit a site map to the sitemap reports in the search console
however site Maps can also be submitted through robots.txt file let's understand
about robots.txt file so let's understand the robots.txt file
in short robots.txt file notifies the web
Crawlers about the URLs that they can access on the website as there are lots of search
engines there exists different web crawlers thus there is a possibility
that some web crawlers may not obey the instructions from the robots.txt file it
is necessary to know how to use the proper syntax as different crawlers
understand syntax differently thus there are chances that some web
crawlers might fail to understand the instructions from the robots.txt file
a page can be indexed even if it is disallowed from the robots.txt file if
it is linked to other site next let's know what enhancement reports
are all the rich results status reports are displayed under the enhancement tab
so let's know more about rich results these type of results are known as Rich
results in serps so basically Rich results can be any search results other
than the traditional Blue Links for example image results carousels
Etc you can check whether the pages from your website support Rich results or not
using the rich result test tool provided by Google Developers
now understanding the rich results status report the enhancement tab
contains separate reports for Rich result type some rich result report types are listed
below that are breadcrumbs education q a event FAQ fact check
guided recipe how to image license
job posting learning video review Snippets
Etc Rich results status reports consist of summary page and Details page
the summary page mainly consists of Errors useful items found on your
website warnings Etc The Details page consists of the
information about the issues when it was detected item type when was the page
last crawled Etc before we understand how to fix
error in search console it is important to understand the status of each page as
reported by search console each page has any of the following
status error warning excluded and valid if the status of the page is valid it
means the page has successfully indexed the status of the page appears to be
excluded if one purposefully wants the page not to be indexed
or a page is blocked by robots.txt file for example setting the meta tag to no
index warnings majorly appears when the page of your website is indexed but
there are some issues with the page which needs your attention and have to
be resolved as soon as possible if the page status is error then there
is a need to pay a detailed attention over the issues in the page as these
issues prevent the page from getting indexed
let's discuss about the errors in detail and how we can fix them
some popular errors from the search console are listed below
that is the redirect error server error submitted URLs blocked by robots.txt URL
marked as no index submitted URL is a soft pore not for not poor or page not
found error so let's first know about the redirect error some redirect error
that search console shows up are the redirect chain that was too long
redirect true redirect URL that exits maximum URL
length and bat or empty URL in the redirect chain so all these error means
that the redirections are not working properly and so there is a need to fix
them so suppose for example you have added too many redirects from one page
to another so in this scenario search engine Bots find it a waste of
time to crawl again and again to the same redirections and at that time the
search engine crawlers or search engine boards ignore those URLs or redirections
so in such cases you need to fix those redirection to a single URL
the next we have is server error the server returns 5xx error when it
fails to fulfill a valid request this error mainly conveys that something is
wrong with your website server all you need to do is reach out to your hosting
services and inform them about the issue and make sure it gets resolved as soon
as possible the next one we have is submitted URL blocked by robots.txt to resolve this
issue you need to remove the line of code from the robot.txt file that
restricts Google from crawling the respective page the next we have is URL
marked as no index when a URL is marked as no index it
sends the signal to crawlers that this page is not meant to be crawled or this
page is not meant to be indexed if you want this page to be indexed check the
metadata and remove the no index attribute to allow the Crawlers to crawl the URL
now let's understand about the error submitted URL is a soft 404 and 404 or
page not found error whenever a web page load server returns a 200 signal showing
the success status code soft4 Note 4 is a condition in which server returns 200
success status code and the page not exist error simultaneously
this is considered to be a bad user experience this error can be solved simply by
redirecting this page to any relevant URL or the home page of the website
talking about 404 or page not bound error this error mainly occurs
when you delete the page from your website but the URL of the page still
exists in the site map this error can be solved by simply
removing the URL or removing the four not four URL from the site map or
redirecting the URL to a new page this will help to avoid the further
errors in near future we will have a detailed look at other 4xx errors in the upcoming videos
now that we are aware of the basics of search console let's dive deeper to know
some stats regarding the search console in the SEO industry
when you're thinking of adding a business online your website should fulfill all the technical SEO needs
which can be achieved by Google search console thus there is a huge demand in
SEO industry for the candidates having strong knowledge of Google search console the average salary of an SEO
expert with the Google search console skills in US is 53 000 dollars
to seventy eight thousand dollars per annum and that in India is 2 lakh 76 000
per annum some biggies in the SEO industry looking
for this skill sets include Accenture Amazon people group
Eton Etc so let me know your dream company to work as an SEO expert in the comment
section below the search engines have put massive resources into developing the visibility
Local SEO
of local and Regional businesses in the search results in addition the massive increase and
prevalence of smartphones over the past few years have made location-based searches and expected everyday
occurrence people expect to find results based on where they are immediately
here's the basic idea behind local now for a long time in the past search
engines wanted to be able to provide results based on where you were in the world in a very precise way
they were able to use this somewhat by using the IP address and they could
approximate where you were but it wasn't always that accurate what they really wanted to know is where you exactly were
within feet or meters now this technology has evolved considerably and in a very short amount
of time using location technology like GPS and Wi-Fi in addition the prevalence of searching
on smartphones accounts for more than 60 percent of searches every day these
factors now enable search engines to know your location and provide incredibly accurate and thorough options
for your search so what's at the core of this well it's
the acronym nap it stands for name address and phone number
this is the most critical factor for any business not just in local SEO but for
local it is critically important all you need to do is on your website
specify one name for your business one address and one phone number
and then when you put that into different directories like Yelp or Yellow Pages or whatever you may be
using you need to make sure that you have exactly letter four letter the same name
and the same address and the same phone number unfortunately this gets
convoluted because the search engine spiders index and classify information
business information can be classified separately all because of the slightest
variation in business name or address making it look like a separate business
now a human would easily be able to identify the difference and classify the variations as a single business
search engines can't do that yet start on your own website specify one name for
your business one address format and one phone number and then use that same identical name and format when you set
up your accounts at different websites and directories like Yelp or yellow pages
you need to make sure you have exactly letter for letter the same name the same address and the same phone number
unfortunately this can be difficult there are a lot of different formats for
phone numbers certainly for addresses and even for names any inconsistency will cause problems
again a human might be able to figure this out easily but using the examples a
search engine would consider this two separate businesses at the same address
or because the address format is different it may even be considered two different businesses at two different
addresses do you see how that works so search engines do not usually know
that they're the same business and this causes all kinds of problems
so let's pretend that your address is one two three Happy Street Suite 3.
there's a lot of different ways you could write this you could spell out sweet you could use just the
abbreviation for it and there's actually two abbreviations for sweet you could also use unit instead of sweet
but Suite numbers and abbreviations are where people lose their consistency even with Road Street Parkway or Avenue
you need to pick just one version spell It And format it exactly the same and use it consistently then find all the
instances of different variations you have online and go fix them
the last part of this is directories so directories for a while now has been
a bit of a bad word it used to be a great way of doing SEO until it got abused
in fact it got abused and overused and abuse was that people would charge a lot
of money so that you could be listed in a directory and now in modern days directories are not like they used to be
and they're not that useful getting links that way and doing link building through directories is not
going to be greatly helpful however the big exception to this is with local SEO
there are important iyps internet Yellow Pages there are also things like Yelp or
Urban Spoon where people go and submit their local businesses real human beings pick up their phone
and they go to the Yelp app and look for businesses and because real human beings are using these unlike the directories
of the past this means that you want to have your business there so in some ways directories at least in
the local space have returned a great example of this are local or even
National Business associations Chambers of Commerce business associations industry associations and
other directories can be good places now after all that let's move on to some
other local signals so the first most important signal is This Acronym again an AP name address
and phone number the key here is that consistency
the next thing is keywords and titles this is extremely convenient because
it's something you should be doing for SEO anyway this is particular for title tags which
is something we've covered in the other videos the next one is domain Authority so if
you have an important domain an important business Google is going to use this as a signal when they're doing
a traditional local search so when someone's on their mobile and
they're looking for a good restaurant if you are an important restaurant in the
city you're going to be more popular in both local search and traditional search
that's domain Authority the next one is inbound link signals this again might
sound familiar the things that help you for traditional SEO do the same for local the first one is Anchor text
so this is one of the most important if you're a great restaurant hopefully you're going to have lots of bloggers
lots of magazines and local online entities that are writing about you and
linking to you they're naturally going to use your name and the name of your business in the
review about you these are the kinds of things that Google is looking for because these are
what is effective online the last one is reviews and citations
but in this context these have very specific definitions it's not just reviews in general like
the ones I've talked about it's reviews on specific local directories or business listings
and it's both the quality of them are you getting five stars and the quantity
of them do you have a hundred reviews do 100 people care enough about your business to review you now the next one
is a bit more complex as it does require some programming on your website this is called schema microdata or structured
data schema is an agreed upon programming standard by search engines
browsers and device manufacturers that directs the markup and display of
specific content it's typically content that is repetitive by nature and therefore if it's displayed in a consistent manner for all devices browsers and operating systems to know the content then they
can display it properly you'll find it in addresses contact cards dates
e-commerce products reviews people places creative works and more
what we're most concerned with here is the address and phone number by using schema when you add your address or
phone number to your website it enables the visitor to use the click to call function on their phone when there's a
phone number on the website in addition using the address schema can open up a map when someone clicks on it to show
the location utilizing this schema provides clear data to the search engine that can be republished across a variety
of channels now specifically for Google's business listings they give a very wide range of content for
businesses to list so fill out as many areas of the business listing as you can business hours payment types accepted
phone numbers descriptions reviews from Google and maybe even from your own website you can link your social
profiles and any events or promotions you have one of the biggest signals that we've seen grow in importance are the
amount of pictures that you load into your business listings in fact Google provides a report as to how many times
the photos are viewed by Searchers many times businesses that have many photos
will show up with more prominence than those that have little or no photos so
take advantage of the listing opportunities that Google provides finally the same behavioral signals that
are used in search are also used in the local search results and this is because the search engines especially Google can
see how Searchers interact with your local listing because it is in their
system the behavioral signals start with how many people search for your business this is directly related to your local
visibility and loyalty so don't forget about your local offline marketing next
they measure how long someone views your listing they count how many times the phone number is clicked for someone to
call or when someone clicks to find directions in addition there's a button
there for directions to be sent to a searcher's phone if they're using a PC or laptop all of these engagement
factors and buttons on a business listing are counted as engagement and task completion which increases the
behavioral signals for your business as people save the listing check in or even visit these all send important
behavioral signals of popularity and loyalty which contributes to your business's visibility and local search
How To Get High Quality Traffic?
before I tell you how to bring traffic to your website let me tell you why this is so important okay why do we want to
bring users to our website I mean it has to be on equal ground as web development
and design is somebody who goes to your site and then does something when they get to your site so you have users and
when those users get to your site they're generating page views and traffic and you want to turn that
traffic into engagement okay so each Page's traffic is configured independently of all their pages so when
you go when somebody goes to your website they look at a page that's a page view and certain pages on your
website you want to turn that page view into a conversion okay whether that be you know looking at a video or
purchasing something so think of these pages on your website as salespeople they're trying to convert visitors who
come to your website but first we need to get the visitors to your website so when you give visitors to your website
again you can generate rate sales which means revenue or you can increase brand
awareness or you can earn Revenue through sponsored post and advertisements so if you have for
example a lot of content on your website you can turn that in to revenue by
hosting ads on your website so when somebody clicks on that ad you're going to earn a percentage of that click okay
what that click is worth so having a website means a lot of good things for
you but first you got to get the traffic there and so what we're going to do is we're going to tell you how to drive
traffic to your website so there's lots of different ways in which you can bring traffic to your website well the first
is paid advertising so paying to advertise your products services with ads is one of the easiest ways to drive
traffic to your website so some of the options available are search ads social
media ads or display ads so search ads or ads that are displayed in the search
engine and results so when a user types in a keyword query you want your ad to
show up based on that keyword query okay so an example is digital marketing course somebody types in digital
marketing course and simply learn is the first app that shows up how do we know it's an ad because you can see the word
add next to the domain so when somebody clicks on that link simply learn is
going to pay Google so that's how search advertising works okay the next is
social it's a social media marketing involves increasing traffic or engagement or brand awareness lots of
different strategies but you're instead of doing this on search you're doing it on a social media platform okay so for
example you can advertise on any particular platform and the way you
advertise could be with an image it could be with a video so in this case you could see cobrio is doing a
sponsored ad here how to succeed with Google flats and then another form of advertising is display so display means
creating ads that are placed on specific websites so with display unlike search
you have a choice in the ad format with search you only have text ads but with display you have text Edge image ads
rich media ads video ads so you have lots of different options in which you
can advertise on other websites so the idea here is to get your ad in front of
the Right audience when they could see your display Banner your banner ad then it's going to be more visual more
appealing generate some brand interest and hopefully you can get somebody to click on that ad and over to your
website so that's paid advertising again through search through social through display but you can also promote your
site on social media so once your content is gone live you could take advantage of different social media
platforms I mean it really depends on what you're you're trying to promote because what you're trying to promote
needs to align with the appropriate social media platform so Facebook is
best suited for Industries like food and Beverages and news and media and if you're selling a product so you fall
into one of those categories and Facebook could be the right platform for you if you're involved in again beauty
or food and beverage or e-commerce then you can also leverage Instagram which is
part of Facebook's ecosystem so if you advertise on Facebook you can also
advertise on Instagram and or Instagram so it doesn't have to be and Facebook
and Instagram it could be Facebook or Instagram you also have LinkedIn as a platform LinkedIn is great for B2B so if
you're trying to promote industry news or or tips and best practices or job
postings then LinkedIn is the place for you it's a B2B platform it's great for
targeting specific Industries targeting specific job levels or job descriptions
okay so LinkedIn is great if you're into B2B focusing on the business side of it
so you also have YouTube now YouTube is part of Google's ecosystem YouTube is a
video platform okay so it's great if you're trying to promote gaming or
entertainment or if you're a vlogger okay so YouTube's a great way to promote
your site by getting your product out there in the form of a video and then you have Twitter Twitter to me
encompasses a lot of different Industries Beauty and fitness news and media entertainment okay you have
limited number of characters but a lot of people are active on Twitter and it's
a great way to generate some awareness and get some clicks over to your website so these are just some of the most
popular social media platforms of course there are plenty more out there the third way in which you can drive traffic
to your site is guest plus blogging so most of you already know what blogging's
all about well if you're blogging for your own site you can jump on somebody else's site and blog on their behalf so
having the opportunity to guess post on another website can be very helpful because one that other blog could have
lots of traffic and have a a well-known brand so if you're blogging on another blog it's going to build your brand
awareness and potentially increase traffic to your blog or website so it exposes to you to targeted traffic so if
you're going to guest blog guest blog on a site that's very relevant to your business or industry that way you're
targeting the Right audience okay you can expand your personal Network so getting yourself out there getting your
brand out there in front of a different audience and then obviously for service because it generates backlinks or serps
search engine ranking Pages means that hey if you want to rank organically you're going to have to generate some
backlinks so guest blogging isn't a way to generate some back links to your site
and in effect that's going to help you get your pages ranked higher because Google is going to recognize the
relationship from one blog to your blog and build up your relevancy so some
other benefits here to guest blogging is you can grow your social media following
because you can then promote that on social media that you're guest blogging okay again you can improve your online
Authority okay because when you're guest blogging and you have recognition on
that Guest block if it's a popular blog then it's going to help your domain and Page Authority for SEO and then the end
result is going to improve your backlink score so the lot of benefits to guest blogging to me at the end of the day
it's just about reaching out to your audience using another platform to do that in the form of a Blog and the
results of that is going to mean more brand awareness for you and turning that traffic from that other blog into
qualified leads so you can also in interview industry thought leader so that's another way an interesting way to
generate traffic to your site so reaching out to thought leaders for interviews okay could generate some
credibility for you and the other person so it's reciprocal so it means that you're active in the industry that
you're in and it allows you to engage with other leaders in the industry and
the indirect net result of that could be increased traffic because if you do the interview and you record it or if it's
via video then you can obviously post it on other platforms and that could in turn Drive traffic to your website
obviously just like guest blogging it's going to increase your reach so getting
yourself out there nobody knows who your brand is and they know who the thought leaders are and they say you're
interviewing the thought leaders then that's going to put you in front of these people and so it's going to
increase your reach another way to drive traffic to your website is just to make sure your website's response and what do
we mean by responsive well we mean does it work on multiple devices specifically
MOBA so depending on the device your website hides shows shrinks and larges
or moves content so that it conforms to the browser that that person's looking
at on your web for your website so if somebody's looking on mobile at your website you want to make sure that your
website adjusts accordingly so you want to be able to you know test to make sure it's responsive and so as content range
based on importance okay does it work across different browsers on different devices and do the images text and
everything else align just like it does on desktop so there are plenty of tools out there on the web all you need to do
is just do a search for you know check my website for responsiveness you know so you you can use plenty of tools to
check to see if your website is responsive towards multiple devices why
is that important because as some somebody goes to your website Via Mobile and your site doesn't align properly or
the content's all stretched out and somebody has to maneuver their browser just to see your website then chances
are they're not going to come back chances are they're not going to convert okay so you want to be able to revise
your device browser combinations you want to make sure that everything works accordingly you want to be able to test
those fonts make sure they look good and then you also want to make sure that
people can navigate so if they're on mobile are they going to navigate just as easy as they can on desktop and if
you have any pop-ups you want to probably make sure they're removed so that way when somebody's looking at your
website they're not getting interfered with on mobile and then of course you
want to make sure that these Pages load okay so they load just as quick on
desktop as they should on mobile and vice versa so this should not take a long time to load so I'm moving on from
responsiveness on mobile to building a brand community so brand community refers to a group of people who identify
your brand and use your brand as a platform to exchange ideas and contribute content some advantages of
having a brand Community are promoting brand evangelism and loyalty it can be a
source of feedback loyalty and ideas so build a community build a brand Community who you know identify with you
okay so continue to you know treat these people as loyal customers okay maybe
give them a promotion uh to use specifically just for them that they can use on your website or talk directly to
them because you know that they're followers they're repeat customers they purchase for you multiple times so talk
to them differently as well you know who these people are and that's what building a brand is all about it's about
identifying your brand with other people okay in an identify people who identify
with your brand and messaging and talking to them as if they're part of your own Community your own family so
you can use user generated content that provides future marketing strategies so
the feedback you get from your own Community could be in turn used to
promote or used in future marketing strategies I.E advertising I.E post on
social okay it can also provide PR opportunities so it's a chance for you to you know put out press releases based
on the community that you built so any brand regardless of who it is should be
able to identify with your audience their target audience and that target audience eventually going to become part
of a community these are group of people who identify with you what you're trying to sell what your cause is what your
mission statement is what your services they identify with you so leverage them
and reciprocate identify them talk to them separately give them the what they
deserve the respect and loyalty that they deserve as well because they're communicating and they're following you
as a brand so the next thing you could do to drive traffic is Be Active in the
comments section so engage in relevant and thought-provoking conversations on
other blogs and sites it doesn't necessarily have to be another blog per se it could be other sites like Reddit
or Cora or Mania sites that have a lot of content that are broken out by
industry that allow you to engage in conversation and allow you to either upvote or share or respond okay so be
active because when you're active people are going to see that hey you're a leader in the industry you know what
you're talking about you have some some brand Equity you have some thought and
some knowledge on the specific topic and subjects so it just puts you in a better
light when you can respond and be active on these different platforms okay let's
turn our attention to search engine optimization also known as SEO or
organic search so in order to drive traffic to your site you're going to have to implement an SEO strategy why do
you want to implement an SEO strategy because it can help you improve your overall searchability and visibility on
search engines and obviously that comes with advantages one of those advantages is obviously more traffic to the site
search is still King in terms of volumes of people using search on a daily basis
so you have a great opportunity to be found it also builds trust and credibility because still a majority of
the people who do a search click on an organic search list in and so if you're
found organically and you're ranked number one then chances are somebody's
going to click on your listing and it provides increasing engagement and traffic and so what that means is more
traffic more engagement and engagement is something you define it could be again a download of a document or the
clicking on the play button of a video or or submitting a form or signing up
for a newsletter or calling these are all forms of Engagement so the the
amount of traffic you drive from organic search to your website is only going to
improve engagement okay so you can also provide an improve user experience and
what do we mean by that well if you're getting lots of traffic from organic search you have a really good
opportunity to do a b testing and when you do a b testing you can improve user
experience meaning you're showing one variation against the other from people coming from organic search and so this
is helpful in that you know if you're running an A B test the variation has a
chance to improve or outperform the original original and if it outperforms the original you're improving user
experience and then it helps Target quality traffic so SEO to me or all search is the only medium in which
you're meeting somebody halfway you're you're addressing what they're looking for so somebody's looking for a pair of
red women's Nike shoes the 2019 model
and you have that particular product to offer well you have a chance of showing
up via organic search somebody types in you know women's red Nike shoes size
whatever at the year 2019 model then of course they're gonna probably likely
click on your listing because you have what they're looking for and and that goes with any keyword any industry any
business any segment any type of product you're selling so again you have a
chance to really be visible for what people are looking for and so that's the beauty of search engine optimization you
have a really good opportunity here to meet people halfway to drive quality
traffic to get them to enjoy a good user experience all the while generating
engagement and along with SEO we want to be able to build backlinks so SEO is a
two-pronged approach meaning you have two strategies in one on page and off page and so off page involves
backlinking so backlinks are just links that direct users from other websites to
your own website so with that inherently it's going to drive traffic qualify
traffic to your website because if somebody's on a relevant website that's linking to yours and they click on that
link and go to your website it's likely going to be qualified meaning they're going to be relevant and so back linking
because it's an off-page strategy why isn't an off-page SEO strategy because if Google crawls that other site that
has a link to you then that's going to give you credit because Google say hey this site's getting some links from some
relevant sites we must think they're relevant and therefore we're going to trust the site so by Google trusting
your site it's going to improve your organic ranking and with the organic rankings being approved meaning it's
going to mean faster indexing so what does that mean so you want to be indexed by the search engines and so the quicker
Google can find your pages even if it's on somebody else's site then that means they're going to follow that link go to
that page on your site and take that page back to their servers to be indexed okay so the quicker you can get index
the quicker you can get found and then it helps with referral traffic so again we noticed that our efforts are on SEO
organic search but if you're getting traffic from another website hey that still counts that's referral traffic
okay so that's a side advantage to having backlinks is good traffic from
other sites okay so those those are inherently the some of the reasons to to do backlinking okay never hurts I mean
there's brand awareness reasons to being on other sites as well there's industry leadership meaning if you you post
content on Reddit okay you're coming across as an industry leader but yet generating a backlink which helps with
SEO and referral traffic so there's a lot of benefits to building backlinks and the opposite of backlinks are
internal links so you want to do internal linking and that just means connecting one page on your site to
another and why is that beneficial because it can help direct visitors to other Pages they wouldn't normally
otherwise find via your navigation so if you're active on a Blog don't be afraid
to include multiple internal links you want to move people through your site you want the flow of traffic to go from
one page to another to another and so when you do internal linking just like with backlinks it's going to improve the
indexing of your website Google's going to follow those links and index those pages and Google does give credit from
an SEO perspective from an internal linking perspective so if one page is
linked to another and that page has really good relevance in the eyes of Google then the other page is probably
going to benefit from that the other reason we want to do internal linking again you want to move people from your
one page of your site to the other and when you do that it's going to reduce bounce rates so bounce rate is simply
the rate at which people land on a page and then leave so if I have a hundred people in on my home page and only one
person went to another page and the other 99 left the site then that's a 99
bounce rate so by putting internal links in place you're helping people move from
one page to the other and thus reducing the bounce rate and that's what you want you want to keep people on your site you
want to be greedy it also drives traffic to older posts so again when we say
older post we're really referring to blog posts so if you have a relevant blog post and you're writing a new blog
post then link the two together if it's relevant link it I don't you know regardless of how old it is you know you
want to show Google that these older blog posts just because they were written a year ago doesn't mean they're outdated and old-fashioned okay or
useless you want to keep them alive by linking to them so to me that's a good strategy for internal linking link to
older blog posts you know show people you're an industry expert you've been doing this for a while and then you have
lots of content to share okay so the longer you can keep somebody on your website the more likely it is they're
going to engage and convert and some other inherent benefits improves pagerank so what we mean by Page rank is
simply just a rank that Google gives pages so the more internal linking you have the better off you are and then it
helps spread link juice across websites and what I mean by link juice again just like backlinking it builds relevancy so
just keep all these inherent benefits in mind to internal linking the end result is keeping the flow of traffic on your
site and all these other benefits will fall into place okay so another way in
which you can really hone in on traffic to your website is long tail keywords and long tail keywords to me are more
than just one or two keyword phrases okay so there are usually three or
longer keywords in a phrase okay so long tail keywords really nowadays account
for most web searches people really take the time to even post questions as a
search query they likely somebody it's unlikely somebody's going to go into search and just type in the word shoes
they might type in red shoes but that's unlikely what they're probably going to type in is you know red Nike running
shoes 2019 or some variation of that okay that's a long tail keyword and some
of the advantages of using long tail keywords to be found for are less competition so if you you're using broad
keywords like red shoes then who doesn't want to be found for Red Shoes well you don't necessarily you don't want to be
found for red shoes because it's too broad you don't know what type of shoes somebody's looking for you just know
they're looking for Red Shoes it could be running shoes it could be work shoes it could be you know boots it could be
slippers okay it's too bright so long tail keywords help narrow it in and the
more narrow and focused a keyword is the less competition is going to have and when something's not competitive in the
form of a keyword then that means your chances of ranking for that keyword are going to be greater and the chance of
you ranking faster are going to be greater and then of course if somebody's looking for exactly what you have to offer then you have a higher chance to
convert that person so if you have exactly those 2019 red Nike women's
running shoes and somebody does a search for that and that's a long tail keyword and they click on your organic listing
if you have the right price then they're probably going to convert so you have a really good chance of converting
somebody using long tail keywords so my point here is if you're looking for keywords to use focus on longer tail
don't focus on one or two keyword phrases what it also does is it brings targeted traffic so even if somebody
doesn't convert hey they could be back because it's exactly what they're looking for and if you're focusing on
longer tail keywords like I just mentioned stay away from the shorter ones it's just easier to optimize your
page for SEO so remember SEO is a two-pronged approach on page and off
page we talked about off page with internal linking and backlinks on page is all about making sure there's
keywords you choose are integrated in with the page you want to be found for and so if you're using a long tail
keyword it's just easy to work that keyword in so it enables easier on-page
optimization okay let's switch away from SEO to email marketing so let's focus on
email marketing as a form or method of driving traffic to your website so email
marketing has been around a long time in terms of digital marketing why because it provides an effective way to convert
leads into sales why because you can send personalized emails to a target audience so when you send an email to
somebody on a regular basis you know who that person is so what are you doing in the email you're writing a specific
message to that person well email marketing is the same thing except you're just sending an email to a larger
group of people and when you send an email to a larger group of people you're still going to personalize the message
right you're not going to send a generic email to 1 000 people okay nobody's
gonna do that so make sure your email is targeted if it's targeted it could be cost effective why because sending large
amounts of emails or let's just say an email to a large amount of people or a
large group of people is going to be cost effective it's not cost per click you know it's not cost per open okay so
email usually depending on the the email provider you're using really is a flat
fee so just really depends on how many emails you're sending or how how many people you're sending the email to as
well so but email generally tends to be more cost effective than other forms of marketing so look at the email content
provider you're using and just get a sense of what they charge but if you look at it and do a comparison email
generally is cheaper than say doing pay-per-click because with pay-per-click you're paying for each click okay so
that could be expensive depending on the keywords so email marketing is also time saving okay meaning it's a one-time
thing and done so once you send the email it's just a matter of you know watching and looking at the metrics and
learning what's going on so you don't make the same mistakes again but it is time conducive meaning you send out one
email and that's it with pay-per-click you're constantly a measuring and managing the campaigns and it provides
real-time marketing so when you do send the email more than likely a majority of the people on day one or the day you
send the email are going to be able to view it open it click on some of the links and convert so that's normally
what happens in email majority of the people open it on day one and it kind of tails off from there so think about it
as real time so when you send that email and if you have a thousand people on your email recipient list break it up
send the first 500 first with a different subject line and then you can see the data come in and if you don't
see the good results from the subject line or the body of the email or you
know the page they're going to then make adjustments before you send the other email to the next 500. so that's a great
thing about emails you can break up the email into two groups the first group and then the second group with different
subject lines and you can probably send them a little bit of time apart that way you can learn learn from the first email
because with email you are generally going to get results right away okay
within the first 24 hours so that's a great thing about email okay so the other thing about email it's less
intrusive so normally people who are going to get the email are the ones who
sign up for the email so they're almost expecting your email so when they get your email again as long as you're not
sending an email on a daily basis normally most companies send it monthly or bi-weekly it's not going to be as
intrusive okay and then it also helps build credibility increase visibility and brand awareness meaning you're going
to build your brand in that email you're going to put content in that email that's going to show off your
credibility meaning you could put some testimonials in the email you can put some good affiliations you can put a
good article to an industry article you just wrote so email is going to inherently continue to build brand
awareness for you okay and it's an easy way to track our Roi so if your e-commerce it's pretty clear you send
the email somebody opens it clicks on it checks out and purchases something it's
easily trackable because you could track it right from that email so one thing I want to say there is just if you do send
an email make sure you're tracking that campaign and you want to be able to use an analytics program like Google
analytics okay if you use Google analytics you're going to be able to track when you send the email who clicks
on it and who converts so you want to be able to measure an Roi for these emails and you can and that's the beauty of
email marketing okay let's move away from email marketing to webinars so webinars great method for Effective
social media promotion it's a great way to bring traffic to your website so why
do we recommend webinars well because it provides direct content contact within
your target group what I mean by contact with your target group well you're going to host a webinar and you're going to
invite this targeted group of people who are interested in your product or service so if you have a Facebook
Community you can do a Facebook live event or you could do a YouTube or you
know you can even set up a webinar and another platform but promote it on social media and if you're pronouning
something on social media you're probably promoting it to people who are already following you or like you and so
that's what we mean by direct contact with your target groups you're you're going to be able to create a webinar and
talk directly to that group and that's going to help build brand awareness and credibility and the great thing about
webinars is you don't need some fancy software I mean I'm talking to you on a webinar right now and so webinars are
free all you need is a video camera and a recorder that's all and that's all
built in with software so there's plenty of software out there that allows you just to do a webinar really quick and
easy there's lots of opportunities in software so and a lot of them are very costly effective so if you want to build
create a webinar you can do that by spending very little money in webinars
again allow you to talk to your your targeted group your community maybe prospective clients it helps build
credibility and in effect Drive traffic to your website and when somebody does attend a webinar they're likely going to
be highly engaged because you're inviting them they're going to opt into the webinar and the great thing about
webinars is even if they don't attend the webinar the day you have it it's going to be recorded so they can always
go back and watch it so whoever watches the webinar is going to be engaged because it's going to be a topic they're
interested in and then users are likely to become prospective customers so having a webinar talking about something
inherently interesting to maybe a larger group of people you can promote that on
social media and potentially get prospective customers to sign up and watch the webinar and if you do they're
going to be engaged and then take the next step oh I like what this guy this person has to say they seem to be
credible I like their personality I like their brand I like their product I'm gonna go check their web out their
website okay so webinars allow you to kind of pull in more people as well as just your community because you can
promote the webinar and you can promote it in advance and you can leverage social media for that okay so something
related to webinars incorporating video content so videos have been proven to be
a really good way to attract new visitors and it just it makes your website very engaging when you have
videos on your website as well so if you create video you have an opportunity to
post it on various video platforms like YouTube or Vimeo okay there's plenty of
video platforms out there or just embedded in a blog post or embed it in a
Facebook post or a tweet okay so you can do a lot with video and having video on
your site is going to increase engagement okay when you increase engagement good things happen that's
going to lead to increased conversions and sales or or Roi or just like we
mentioned the webinar can help build trust with your audience so even that webinar you could post on your website
so you want people to engage by watching this video they watch the video they're going to gain trust in you because
you're talking directly to that person that user that audience that visitor to your website and when you get Bell trust
it's going to increase engagement and that's the beauty of video unlike text
or imagery videos really do engage with the audience and so the more video you
could do the better off you are because again you can leverage social to draw attention to your brand and product and
service and then you can have that video on your website to increase engagement which in turn increases conversions and
sales and improves Roi so always they think video there's plenty of video software out there that you can leverage
and the great thing about video two is hey most people are using mobile phones these days smartphones and so video
works just as well on mobile as it does on desktop so keep that in mind you know
video is going to be engaging regardless of what device somebody uses and then of
course if they're watching the video on Facebook or YouTube then it's chances are they're going to share that
particular video which is going to bode well for your brand and traffic okay so video if somebody likes a video it's
very easy to share video especially from a mobile phone so YouTube just makes it so easy to share or like or subscribe to
a channel it just it becomes that much easier things can go viral and chances
of them going viral with video are going to be greater okay so other ways to drive traffic to your website is submit
your content to content aggregators so what's a Content aggregate Gator well content aggregators like Reddit that
provides a great platform for you to post your content so that's what a Content aggregator is really a site like
Reddit or medium or quora where you could post content to a large number of people okay so with Reddit people are
either going to upvote it or download it so the more upvotes you get are thumbs
up or likes or people who encourage that content the more of a chance it has to
be found and so first thing out of the gate if you do provide content to a Content aggregator like Reddit make sure
it's good quality content that's interesting and that should be a case the case around across the board whether it's a social post or blog post make
sure the content's unique professional and interesting and then if you do say put something on medium or you do put
something on quora and it is professional and interesting and thought provoking then people are going to react
to it and then that again could lead to traffic but even if it does doesn't lead to traffic it helps build brand
awareness so if you have content just like videos leverage it put the content out there okay and when you put content
out there it's only gonna especially if it's good content put it's going to put you in a good light so don't be afraid
to share your content on the likes of Reddit or medium or core or some of
these other content aggregator websites because good things are only going to happen and again referral traffic SEO
brand awareness conversions so all these are inherent benefits of just sharing
your content okay and then finally we want to learn from analytics okay so what do I mean learning from analytics
so there are plenty of analytics platforms out there one of the most popular is Google analytics so you want
to make sure you're tracking traffic on your site with Google analytics so I have to do is just go to Google
analytics via search sign up add the analytics code to your website and voila
they're doing all the heavy lifting they're going to to track traffic coming your website and not only they're going
to track traffic but they're going to tell you how that traffic engaged and so the benefits of it Google analytics is
hey you could figure out where users are coming from are they coming from that email campaign that I sent out to a
thousand people are they coming from YouTube based on that video I posted or are they coming from Reddit based on the
content I just posted there or they come in from organic search it is so Google
analytics can help us understand how much traffic we're getting from organic search so it'll help us measure our SEO
efforts and then with Google analytics you could segment so we could segment by mobile we can segment by desktop
returning user new user by campaign by Page by Language by city by region I
mean there's so many ways in which to segment your audience and segmenting simply is breaking up the entire group
of people who come to your website into different segments based on on what you want to say so if you want to look at
you know females between the ages of 18 to 24 who come from mobile via organic
search that's a segment and you can look at that information and analytics if
that's your target audience then you could see how they're performing okay so Anna there are a lot of benefits to
Google analytics definitely wants to take advantage of segmenting in Google
analytics you could look at your competition so there's a benchmarking report the great thing about Google
analytics you can also look at content and how your content is performing once
somebody lands on your website are they what page are they spending time on what page are they engaging on the most okay
what pages have the highest bounce rate or the lowest time on page so you can really determine what pages work best
and then of course the end result in analyzing all this data is you want to
be able to fine-tune your website so take advantage of the data that Google analytics or or any other analytics
platform has given you by learning once you learn what's going on with your website you can make adjustments to your
website to improve user experience okay so we went over a lot of different ways
to drive traffic okay you can incorporate all this to your website immediately
How To Rank #1 On Google?
let's talk about that keyword research for a website with shoes and it doesn't
really matter what particular product you have if you need to rank number one
on Google it all starts with the keywords as I mentioned before and so in
this example if you have a website where you sell shoes for kids you're going to want to be found for certain keywords so
the obvious keyword here would be shoes for kids well every keyword that you
target has search volume associated with it so that means when we talk about
search volume we're talking about how many people on average type in that
keyword or related keyword on google.com or Google search and there's always an
average number of searches associated with every keyword and we call that search volume how much search volume so
obviously if we're going to Target a keyword we want to have as much volume as possible however there's always going
to be competition for those keywords meaning there's always going to be other websites who want to rank number one on
Google for the same keywords and we call that competition or difficulty so for
every keyword you're going to have volume and you're going to have competition or difficulty and the difficulty ranges as well depending on
the tool you use and we'll get into that in a minute but search volume is how
much on average people are typing in that keyword or close variance of that keyword and the difficulty is measured
in terms of how many other websites are trying to rank for the same keyword and
so ideally when it comes to keyword research we want to find that nice balance we want high volume and we want
low competition but at the same time we want to focus on keywords that are highly relevant to our business so if
we're selling shoes for kids and shoes for kids is highly relevant has high
volume in low competition then that's a keyword we want to Target so we always want to focus in on those three areas so
there's always a trade-off with keywords so shoes for kids might have high volume but also might have high competition or
difficulty if we look for another keyword that's just as relevant for example shoes for children it may still
have high search volume but the competition or the difficulty may be lower and if that's the case then that
may be a better keyword for us to Target instead of something highly competitive
like shoes for kids we can focus on another relevant keyword like shoes for
children with just as much volume and lower competition and the reason why we
want lower competition is because we want to be able to rank for that keyword so the higher the competition the harder
it is for us to rank number one on Google for that keyword and so the whole
idea be on keyword research is analyz amazing and choosing the best keywords so we want to identify a list of
keywords that are always relevant we want to choose the keyword that your competitors are ranking for and we want
to use third-party tools to choose keywords to identify which keywords have
low competition and what keywords have high search volume so one thing to take
into consideration when you're doing keyword research is that the longer the key word phrase or in other words long
tail keywords or keywords with three keywords in the phrase or more you're going to always have less competition
but there's always a trade-off with long tail keywords meaning the longer the keyword phrase there's going to be less
volume but the trade-off is less competition and so what we want to do is we want to brainstorm some ideas and
find those relevant keywords so let's look at an example here so if we go to
Google ads so Google ads has a total Keyword Planner and let's just say I
have a a website where I'm selling dried figs and if I'm selling dried figs I
want people to buy these dried figs however in order to attract them I want to be able to show them that hey we have
a bunch of recipes and if I show you a bunch of recipes where you can use dried
figs maybe you'll buy these dried figs to use in these recipes and so we're
going to look for keywords related to bread recipes because if we can optimize
for our recipes page for bread then that will attract an audience who wants to
make bread and use dried figs with those bread recipes so that's the example I'm going to give here and so if I look at
the Keyword Planner and Google ads if I just type in bread recipes what Google is going to do is they're going to give
me an average monthly search volume so I can see the average monthly search volume here is 60 500. and so in order
to keep word research what I would recommend is keep a spreadsheet and so the idea behind the spreadsheet is to
document the volume and the competition you're getting for certain keywords so if I go into a spreadsheet here my theme
of keywords is bread recipes my keyword is bread recipes and my volume therefore
is going to be sixty thousand five hundred however if I go back into Google's Keyword Planner Google's
telling me the competition is low so that's great I want high volume I want
low competition but how low is low so we want to be careful so if we're going to
put in numbers into a spreadsheet we want to figure out what that competition really is for the keyword bread recipes
so if I go to Google and just type in bread recipes I'm going to be able to see
771 billion results for the keyword bread recipes now with 771 billion are
real competition maybe maybe not what we want to do is put in a syntax and we
want to put in the syntax all in title and then colon space and then our keyword and the reason why we do that in
search is because we want to be able to identify the true competitive number or
the true number of websites or trying to rank for bread recipes and if we put in
the syntax all entitled colon and then our keyword bread recipes we'll be able
to see that there are 998 000 results that's a lot lower than 771
billion so that means that 998 000 sites or listings have the keyword
bread recipes in the title tag and the title tag is what shows up in the search
engine results and so if I look down and scroll down here I can see bread recipes on every one of these title tags so
title tag is an important element to rank number one on Google and we'll talk
about that in a few minutes but if we understand that there are 998 000
results with bread recipes in the title tag then this tells us that those are the websites who are trying to rank
number one on Google for that keyword and therefore those are the websites we need to jump over in order for our
website to rank number one on Google and so therefore I'm going to put in 998
000 in my spreadsheet as the competitive number and so now I could see for the
keyword bread recipes I have 60 500 and if my competition is 998 000 then my Kei
or keyword Effectiveness index or in other words the ratio of volume to
competition is six percent so that's nothing more than volume divided by
competition so that tells me that my Kei or my ratio which between volume
competition is six percent so remember we want more volume than we want
competition so anytime you do a keyword research you're going to find a number of different relevant keywords so if I
go back into Google's Keyword Planner if I typed in bread recipes you could see
that Google is going to give me a number of different keywords related to bread
recipes let's just say I have another keyword that I want to think about optimizing for being ranked on Google
for and that's banana bread recipe very similar keyword as bread recipes except
it's a little longer tail now if I type in banana bread recipe and Google's
Keyword Planner now I can see the average monthly search volume has actually gone up it's 368
000. I can also see the competition is low so those are good signs so now I can
see 368 000 I'm going to go ahead and put that in my spreadsheet now I'm gonna go into
to Google I'm going to put in my syntax all in title I'm going to put in banana bread recipe I'm going to hit enter and
now I can see I have 233 000 results with the keyword banana
bread recipe in the title tag so if I look at the title tags I can see banana
bread recipe banana bread recipe banana bread recipe on all the listings in the
Google search results so that tells me I have 233 000 results that I have to jump over in
order to rank number one on Google so I'm going to put 233 000 in my spreadsheet now I can see my
Kei or my volume to competition ratio is 157 158 and so to me that's a lot better
number to work with or in other words that's a lot better keyword because it's
just as relevant and it has a higher ratio of volume to competition so
therefore banana bread recipe is going to be a better keyword to optimize for
in order to rank number one on Google so that's the whole idea behind keyword
research you want to brainstorm ideas there are plenty of tools out there so
the tool I recommend is Google ads Keyword Planner Google's going to give
you how much search volume they're going to tell you the competition but then you're going to go into Google search
you're going to use the syntax on title to get a more accurate read on the
actual competitive number and so to find out how keywords that your competitors are ranking for you can use those
keyword tools that I mentioned another tool that I use is Miles so Moz if you
go to moz.com they have a tool called keyword Explorer so if we just type in
the keyword for example bread recipes it's going to be able to tell us how
much volume and the difficulty so you can use other tools at your disposal
figure out the volume and the difficulty there are plenty of tools out there but the one thing I would just make sure is
you use everything at your disposal so you can use social media to find the
most shared article for a particular topic or keyword like bread recipes you can check other platforms that have a
lot of shared content like Reddit and quora where you can ask people about certain topics using keywords to figure
out how much competition or volume there might be you could stay up to date on industry news to get an idea of what
types of keywords are trending but when it comes to keywords and keyword research remember for every web page we
want to be able to pick two keywords we want a primary and secondary keyword so
when we do keyword research and we enter all our keywords into our spreadsheet we
want to be able to have a number of different keywords in this case we're focusing on the theme bread recipes we
want to have different keywords because we want to be able to choose a primary keyword and a secondary keyword because
we want to be able to focus on multiple keywords for each page because we don't want to put necessarily all our eggs in
one basket meaning we won't want to put all our emphasis just on one keyword to rank for we want multiple keywords to
try and rank for so the primary keyword can Define the nature of our business the secondary keyword could be just
highly relevant to our keyword at the end of the day we want to choose multiple keywords to try and rank on
Google for that page so for example we have a Blog and we're using ice cream
recipes and we're blogging about ice cream recipes we can have the primary keyword that is about ice cream recipes
or homemade ice cream recipes we're going to always want to find out what the volume and the competition is our
sec secondary keyword could be built around other similar keywords like
low-fat ice cream recipes or fat free ice cream recipes or low-fat homemade
ice cream recipes those are complementary keywords just like our bread recipes and banana bread recipe so
one thing we want to do when we do keyword research is we want to be able
to Target one keyword per content when you can Target many we want to be able
to Target multiple keywords not necessarily Target one keyword and so we
want to be able to Cluster keywords so we don't want to Target just one we want to Target multiple keywords per page and
when we talk about clustering if we go back to our keyword research what we're
doing is we're clustering a bunch of keywords under the theme bread recipes and so by looking at the volume looking
at the competition looking at the Kei we can choose different keywords for our
page and that's what we mean by clustering we want to Cluster keywords into a Content frame so why Target only
one keyword per content when we can Target many because we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket we don't want
to Target just one keyword we want to Target many and so that means clustering your keywords into a theme and choosing
multiple keywords for that particular page and when we do that we have a
better opportunity to rank high on Google Search and the whole idea behind
ranking high on Google Search is we can get the volume so if we know we're ranked number one on Google search for
bread recipes or banana bread recipe we know we stand a chance of getting a
majority of the volume associated with that keyword and if we can get the
volume and get the traffic then we can get the conversions so let's move on to
high quality content and talk about the impact content it has on your ability to
get your website ranked number one on Google so let's just say you have
content on your website and the content is ranking on you know page four of
Google and it's that blog with ice cream recipes and if it's just content for the
sake of content it's not really informative then it's not necessarily going to get good engagement in the eyes
of Google you know they want to rank content that's very informative it's very fresh it's exciting to read it's
interesting it's going to have good engagement so if it's a recipe or an
article about any topic if it's the content is just non-informative then
you're not going to get good engagement and when you don't get good engagement if people don't stay on the site to
engage in the content and they just leave the website after landing on the page causing a bounce then the content
is just going to continue to fall down on the rankings and we want to prevent that we want to move up the rankings we
want to be number one on Google we don't necessarily want to fall in the rankings
for our content so content is a key driver and being able to rank number one
on Google so if the content is on page nine what can we do well we want to be
able to you know take that content and do something with it we feel like we did write engaging content so let's go ahead
and share it on social media and to me social media is a good platform to share
your content because on social media platforms like Facebook for example you're building a community on that
platform that Community is already interested in your content so if you're sharing an ice cream recipe especially
in the summertime and you're engaging with your community on that platform then the likelihood of that community on
that platform is going to increase engagement increased engagement will
send social signals to the search engine that says hey this content is good
quality likewise for any other platform most social media platforms have engagement metrics and those engagement
metrics pass signals is it good is it not good do we like this content are we
giving it a thumbs up are we going to want to follow it are we going to want to share it and so if you share content
that you feel is engaging on social platforms then it's going to be engaging and it's likely going to cause an
increase in engagement for example a decrease in balance and once you share
that quality content then the likelihood of it moving up the rankings even as far
as number one on Google is going to be greater so you always want to start out writing good quality content so let's
talk about good quality content because Google does take content seriously they
do take into account what other people think of that content so high quality content is an important factor so how to
create good content that's always the question so let's talk about some best practices here remember in the last
segment we talked about keyword research so we want to perform good keyword research why because we want to choose
keywords remember we're choosing multiple keywords per page one keyword could be related to our brand one
keyword could be related to the content but another keyword could be related to a user's intent like recipes if you
recall the example we use with bread recipes maybe somebody's looking to type in a keyword that says how do I make you
know a bread or how do I make a specific type of bread or how do I make banana bread or what's the best recipe for
banana bread they're question related and we want to be able to answer those questions so that's where choosing those
right keywords that's going to respond to a user's intent so starts with
choosing the right keywords so remember we talked about a number of different tools when we talked about keyword
research so there's a research tool that you can use called phrase.io and that
will help you do quick research on you know keywords and Trends and whatnot so
if you know a better research tool that you use for keyword research then drop us a comment below I'd be interested in
getting your comments about keyword research and what research tools are out there so if you know something better
than phrase.io drop a comment below and we'd be interested in getting your perspective so keyword research is key
but creating content that fulfills users requirements so answering those questions it's a recipe we want to
answer that question if it's directions we want to answer that question if they don't know how to do something we want
to answer that question then that's the whole idea behind content content is not just a fill a page it's to really
fulfill users requirements that's when you get good engage engagement so if somebody's typing in something on Google
and they're looking for an answer your content should answer that question but we also want to make the content
readable so in other words you know write for your audience don't impress
anybody with very high vocabulary type words that somebody doesn't necessarily
know the meaning of don't use jargon don't use a street language for example
use everyday common language that's just easily digestible when your audience is
reading and then we want to keep that content organized and so when we mean organized we want to use headers and
subheaders you know break your content into paragraphs keep the flow organized if we can keep the flow organized then
it's going to be easier for somebody to read and then it's okay to add resources especially resources from credible sites
so if you can incorporate those resources in there then it's just going to add The credibility to your content
let the audience know that hey I I've done my research on this topic and this is what this person has to say about it
this person who seems to be credible okay so it only adds value to your content so these are all tips to
Remember When creating content and then the one important tip here is we want to
use white hat techniques and when we say white hat techniques that means you know if we've chosen keywords that are going
to answer somebody's question we don't want to stuff those keywords into the content we want the content to be
naturally written so when we say opt for wide hack techniques that's what we mean write the content naturally keep it
organized keep it readable include third-party sources and make sure it
answers a question so there are different types of content so there's content where you just write words to
install text based you could also use an infographic infographic is simply just a
graphic that visualizes exactly what you're trying to explain for example if
we want to write an article about how to write good engaging content we don't
necessarily have to write all that out as a text we can create an infographic so for example here's an infographic on
20 effective ways to basically not bore your readers but write engaging content
so you could see this is an infographic it's all graphically laid out so infographics tend to be easier to
understand because they're visual they're easy for the end user to comprehend because there's generally no
jargon it's usually images that are portraying the points of what you're trying to get across and so it tends to
break it up the monotony of just text it's more visually appealing and it's
laid out and organized so you can see this infographic has 20 different steps
or rules and they lay those out all here in this infographic and the great thing I like about infographics is you could
you could share them on social media you can re-engage them as a post you can save them from really any social
platform so infographics tend to tell a better story and versus say just writing
text you can use video and images so you don't necessarily have to lay it all out in an infographic you can certainly
insert a video or an image into your content especially if it's a blog post
if it's a blog post then sometimes video and image is on its own tell the story
you don't necessarily need text to go ahead and tell your story a video or an
image as they say tells a thousand words and so images and videos are great to
use in a blog post so using different forms of content you know you always want to review your content when a user
dwells on your web page for a longer time Google will tend to think okay this person's engaged so we're going to rank
that favorable so if you're using infographics videos and images then the
chances of somebody being more engaged are going to increase versus just text that's not well organized and written
out in a way that somebody doesn't necessarily understand so be creative in
the types of content you use so longer engaging content tends to bode well with
search engines so this is according to HubSpot so the more word count you use
the more words you use the chances of you ranking higher are going to be better just take into account best
practices you want to maybe break up the content with an image organize it make
it engaging use headers so it's not necessarily just words it's the words and how those words are written how
they're structured the types of keywords you're using how you're engaging with your audience there's a lot of factors
again there's best practices we just went over but the key is you know if you have longer more engaging content then
it's going to bode better for you on search engines so a couple of steps to
create high quality content so you want to begin with a comprehensive introduction so always introduce your
content remember the content should be relevant to the keywords so if you're choosing keywords and your keyword
research think about answering that question if somebody's typing in bread recipes maybe they're looking for banana
bread recipes how to make the best banana bread or how to make banana bread
using dried figs we want to be able to align our content with that keyword
naturally you want to create a title that's worthy that's click worthy so remember if you're in Google search and
you're doing search for something simple like bread recipes we want to make
something that's going to be you know engaging for somebody to click on like easy perfect yeast spread are easy
crusty French bread or something that's going to be engaging you know the best bread recipes or how to make the best
homemade bread you know something that's going to draw somebody's attention to the title of that blog post so we want
to include LSI keywords so what I mean by LSI keywords in your content we mean
you know long tail keywords make it natural headings and subheadings should
consist of keywords and variants so if you're writing headers and subheaders
include the keyword in there and that way the content always stays relevant to
the audience okay shorten your sentences in paragraphs so don't write long paragraphs remember we want to break
this up we want to make it easier for the end user to read and we want to
always put internal links on our blog post why because if we have internal
links then if we have a link from one blog post to another blog post or say
our blog post to an internal page on our website we want to make sure that it's
relevant content that way somebody's reading something and you have an internal link let's just say from a
bread recipes page to a banana bread recipes page then they may find it
interesting click on that link and go to the banana bread recipes page so it's keeping somebody engaged on your website
so putting in internal linking will help keep the end user engaged because you're
offering up links that's relevant to the content you always want to break up that content with images okay we want to use
alt tags meaning we want to pen the image with text so that way if the image
doesn't load then at least the alt text will load so we can incorporate call out
boxes and more importantly we want to update our content regularly so we
always want to get the best recipe out there if it's banana a bread or
different ways to Crepe banana bread or always just coming up with ways to update the content so we want to keep
our content our blog post fresh and then we want to include a CTA call to action if we include a call to action then
that's going to keep somebody engaged and have them act on your content so
these are steps to creating high quality content and so let's look at an example
here and this is a three-month-old post on BuzzFeed and it's 21 pictures that
restore your faith in humanity so it has a lot of likes a lot of tweaks and that
means it's engaged people are engaged when reading that and so if we go and look at it as an example we could see it
on a buzzfeed here 21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity so this
was written back in 2012. again a lot of Engagement but if we look at it we can
see immediately that it's taking into account third-party sources it's got some content it's got images it's being
broken up by images we could see there's call to actions on there in the form of
social so people can go ahead and go ahead and share it if they like it okay
it includes videos includes images third-party sources so it's a good post
because says listen you know it's engaging content it's probably answering somebody's question about humanity and
we could see clearly that look you know there's a lot of different examples here from a lot of different sources and we
could take action on this content so not just video not just images but text as
well and so it's very engaging answers questions takes into account the different types of content available so
this is a good post in that regard so contents updated regularly it's engaging
and it includes sources from high Authority websites some do's and don'ts
on the content so take into account the best practices I mentioned about creating high quality content okay
answer those questions that the end user wants to hear you know because that likely is going to be their search and
so you want to be able to respond to the end user that's part of creating high quality content different types of
content I.E in the form of infographic or videos or text or images you can add
images from public domain sites you can be relatable and use examples to clarify
points just like the BuzzFeed article simplify complex words don't use sophisticated language talk to your
audience as if you they were standing right in front of you and use bullet points to exemplify your examples your
points so some Do's the don'ts obviously don't lift content we don't want to lift
content from another website so that's plagiarism so we want to have our own unique content we also don't want to
take images from other websites and so if you do happen to find an image that
works for your post and it's on somebody else's website ideally that's not a good
situation but if you do happen to do that then always give credit to the website okay so if you took it from
xyz.com credit xyz.com for the image and even put a link back but ideally you
don't want to take images from other websites just as much as you don't want to take copy you don't want to take
images use your own imagery and content but if you don't have imagery then you
can always go to stock photography there are plenty of websites out there where you can sign up for a subscription like
Adobe stock images as an example you can sign up for an account and in some cases
you can sign up for a free account and use stock imagery okay don't give less information to your audience give them
to your audience what they deserve which is the information they're looking for they're looking for the best banana
bread recipes give them the best banana bread recipes incorporate your own images break it up with titles give them
a good quality piece of content that they're going to be able to engage with and so if you put long paragraphs in
your content then it's going to be less engaging so try to avoid those long paragraph graphs remember shorten up the
paragraphs keep the language simple add in images answer those questions use
third-party credible sources but write it in your own words and you should be on your way to creating good quality
content okay so now that we've talked about high quality content in order to
get your pages ranked high on Google search let's turn our attention to
optimizing on-page elements and discuss some website level factors that are both
going to help you rank high on Google search so let's just do an overview of what we're talking about when we talk
about on-page elements and website level factors so optimizing on page elements
include a number of different things but primarily we're going to focus in on meta tags also known as meta description
tags header tags also known as title tags and URLs so those are just some of
the on-page elements we want to be able able to optimize using relevant keywords
in order to rank on Google search we also want to take a look at some website
factors that will affect our ranking on Google search they include website
architecture having a secure website having a site map and taking a look at
page speed so all of those are some of the website factors we need to take into
account in order to rank high on Google search so title tag and meta description
together are considered meta tags so both play an important role in ranking
high on Google so we want to be able to write unique title and descriptions for
each page on our website when I say unique that means a title In The Meta description need to be different for
every page on the website and so if you're not quite sure what a title tag in a meta description tag is if you go
to search and just type in any particular our search query the title tag is what's going to show up here and
bold and then the description is going to show up below it below the URL and
that's going to describe the page so both of these meta tags are important
because it describes what your page is all about and that's what Google uses in
the search results pages so we want to be able to pay attention to the length of our meta tags so if we go back to our
search results Pages met title tags are generally 60 65 characters meta
description tags are generally 160 characters so anything really longer
than that then what's going to happen is the meta description tag or the title
tag will get trunk at it and so if we look here for example we could see all
of the title tags here fit the 65 character limit but if you run over the
character count on meta description then Google is going to truncate the copy so
you want to stay within your parameters in order to avoid getting your content truncated and so the other thing when
we're writing title meta description tags we want to minimize keyword repetition so if we're optimizing for
keyword we don't want to necessarily just plug that keyword into the title tag and meta description multiple times
we want to make sure our title tags and meta descriptions are naturally written
so if somebody's typing for banana bread recipe with dried figs you know we want to have a nice title tag and a
description that is going to get somebody to respond based on their need
and so we definitely want to avoid keyword repetition but we want to be able to use that keyword in the title
tag because if you remember from the earlier segment when we did the all in title syntax to find out exactly how
many competitors were using that particular keyword well we obviously want to use that keyword in the title
tag because again the title tag is an important factor when it comes to search engine results so we want to use the
keyword but we want to avoid stuffing or using it repetitively in our title tag
and our meta description we want the title tag and The Meta description to describe the page sound natural but also
be engaging because the point is we want people to click on our link and go to
our website from search engines so title tags with numbers tend to result in
higher click-through rates this is according to mods so for example if you just put in a title tag that says learn
digital marketing well that may work but if you put a number in there like five
easy ways to learn digital marketing that might get somebody to click on your
link and go to your website so having questions in your meta tags can also increase your click-through rate for
example if you just put learn the importance of first page rankings not too bad but again generic but if you put
it into the formal question how to rank number one on Google it's more action oriented it's gonna get somebody to
resonate with the question that they have and that may be their query how to rank number one on Google and so these
techniques will help you get higher click-through rates and so according to
backlinko title tag with a keyword can improve site ranking so remember we want
to include that keyword in the title tag even though we only have 65 characters we want to include that keyword but we
want to avoid stuffing the keyword in there we want to again make the title tag action oriented maybe with the
number maybe as a question with the keyword in there once naturally not easy
to do but that's the beauty of SEO if you can follow these best practices and
write a good title tag then the chances of you you improving in your search
results are going to be greater so having only one H1 tag in your post is
going to be good so remember when somebody clicks on a link so let's say
they do find a title tag engaging and they click on this this link here and
they go to that website you know you want to start out with having that particular H1 Tech because the H1 tag
especially with the keyword in it is going to signal to Google hey we're organizing our page and because it's an
H1 tag it's important we're structuring the page according to best practices so
having only one H1 tag in your post is definitely helpful having multiple tags
H tags in your post help organize the page a lot better so we want to add that
targeted keyword in that tag and your pattern tag should be relevant to the content so if we go back to our example
of the using Drive figs with banana breads why well the title says California fig banana bread and remember
the last segment when we're talking about high quality content well look no further than including a video into our
content so not only will this video help keep the engagement high but it breaks up the monotony of the page and it's
from a third-party source so it adds credibility to the page so adding a video based on the last segment of high
quality content definitely helps with ranking high on Google search so
following hierarchical structure that means putting those H tags in there H2
tags help break up the content and we want to avoid repetition of H1 tags on
your different web pages of your site meaning don't just put the same H1 tag
with the same keyword in it and keeping it blase we want to make those H1 tags
exciting to read but also used appropriately to break up the content so
remember all white hat techniques we want to avoid hidden tags we want to
avoid stuffing keywords we want things to be natural we don't want things to be
forced and your H1 tag should be 20 to 70 characters don't make long H1 tags if
we go back to our page example a short sweet tag here California fig banana
bread it's relevant to the content it's short sweet and breaks up the monotony of the content and more importantly and
again any content you have on the page should always answer the user's intent
remember people are using search to answer questions find information our
content should be able to answer that for them so according to John Moeller senior webmaster Trends Analyst at
Google header tags would definitely help Google for rankings in the search results so we want to use header tags so
when it comes to URLs we want to use hyphens and avoid avoid underscores so
if we look at this URL here this uses hyphens fig and banana bread so it's all
broken up with hyphens that's the best practice remember canonical URLs a
canonical URL signals to Google this is the original content so we want to use
original content and if you have multiple sources of content out there on say different websites we want to use a
canonical tag to signal to Google this is the original content please Index
this content and not doesn't hurt to use a favicon URL meaning a small icon and
helps to break up the monotony and help your URL stand out we can add targeted
keywords in the URL so again looking at the URL here I can see we're using targeted keyword as part of the URL
structure fig and banana bread and that is the H1 tag is fake banana bread so
it's all consistent and it flows naturally your URLs that are no longer
existing then we want to be able to set up a redirect for those URLs meaning a 301 redirect is a server response for
Google that says Hey Google this page is no longer available but it we permanently redirected it to this page
which is now available so that's what a 301 redirect does it helps signal to Google and all the other search engines
that if the page is no longer there that's fine you're just going to go to this page this is the page that's
permanently there now and another thing we want to do here is if you have mobile
URLs you want to include those in the site map and we're going to hit on that in just a minute but all urls should be
mobile friendly as well as desktop friendly meaning take into account this best practices keep your URLs short use
hyphens put the keyword in that URL and make it easy to understand want to avoid
capital letters in the URLs the URLs are case sensitive so go lowercase you
should always go lowercase from the URL readable URLs again the rule of thumb
here is if you understand what the URL is then Google is going to understand
what the URL is so the shorter the URL the easier it is to read the easier it
is to read the better chance you have to rank high on Google search so according to backlink to URLs that are shorter
definitely definitely help you rank so we want to be able to shorten those URLs
keep them short and sweet don't make them long and unreadable so those are
some on optimized ways or on-page elements that help you optimize now we
want to look at some website level factors that will help you optimize and write client Google search so good site
structure provides better crawling for search engine Bots and what do we mean by that well we mean having your site
organized in a fashion that Google's going to be able to find all the pages so so what do we mean by that create a
logical hierarchy structure so if you're selling shoes you know you're going to have a home page break the structure up
into men's shoes women's shoes Children's Shoes then under men's shoes you can have it by brand it could be
Nike Puma Adidas on the women's side it could be Nike Puma Adidas on the child
side it could be Nike Puma Adidas and so you want to keep the structure flow in a
hierarchy so we want to balance the amount of subcategories within each category so the men's if it has Nike
Puma Adidas the women should have Nike Puma Adidas and so you want to code your
site navigation and CSS or HTML meaning we want to be able to use something that
Google is going to be able to index so most sites are built in HTML and that's
what Google likes to index they like to index something that they could take back to their servers and then more
importantly build a comprehensive structure for internal linking so internal links mean that if you're on a
site you should have natural lengths pointing to other pages on your website so to keep the flow going we don't want
to have unnatural inbound things you always want to have natural internal
links to keep the flow of the user going from one page to the other so here I could see as an example all the
ingredients in this recipe well this has an internal link to another page on our site and this happens to link to a page
where somebody can buy the ingredients so it's a natural internal link so John
Doherty of Credo has claimed that one of the biggest changes that he can make in
fixing the Credo website is architecture so for example in Credo John Doherty has
increased the organic sessions by 74 in Pages by per session by 41 just by
changing the site architecture so you'd be surprised by changing the side architecture what that will do to
engagement and so let's turn our attention to secure versus nonsense secure so what we mean by that is
securing your site we want to make it sure that compliant with certain
protocols and so if we go back here we can see that this particular site is compliant it is secure https means it
has a secure license meaning the site is secure so Google likes secure versus
non-secure so non-secure would be HTTP so we want https as our protocol and
what that means is this enabling SSL certificates and that means when you
enable an SSL certificate that means your domain or your protocol is going to be turned to https so Google prefers
sites that are secure versus non-secure so if you use hsts as a protocol that
adds an extra layer of security over the https and
hsts prevents cookie hijacking so adding multiple layers of security always helps
in my opinion if you have an HTTP website a non-secure website you should
look into buying an SSL certificate getting your sites flipped over to https
because what's going to happen is your url structure is going to change when your url structure changes Google is
going to recognize that because they're going to index your site and when they index your site they're going to see those secure URLs and that's going to
work favorably in your favor and help you rank higher on Google search so
websites using secure or https have a higher chance of ranking higher so https
is a ranking signal because Google indexes those pages so let's also talk
about site Maps so sitemap is one of the most important ways to improve your website ranking why well because
sitemaps are a way to organize all your URLs into one file so we're basically
going to prioritize all our web pages in a site map so if you go to any
particular website and you type in sitemap.xml you're likely going to see
all the pages on your website so usually the site map is located in the root
directory so if I type in sitemap.xml I'm going to be able to see all the
pages in my root directory and I can also prioritize them I can also alert
Google as to how often they change and every page is going to have a date stamp
associated with it so Google can actually see how often it changes so remember we want our content to be
updated frequently so content's not updated frequently or it's not fresh then Google's gonna see that size that
date stamp that last modification down so we want to be able to make sure content is updated frequently we want to
let Google know that we change it frequently and we want to be able to prioritize our Pages let Google know hey
these pages are important to us so all that can be set up in a site map we want
to be able to add canonical versions of URLs in the sitemap so we want to be able to add all our original URLs in our
sitemap and so we always want to build Dynamic URLs site maps for larger websites and what I mean by Dynamic URLs
that means that if I look at this side map and we're always adding content let's just say in the form of a Blog
well guess what we want those pages to be added to the sitemap as they're published so as we add pages to the blog
or to the site then they should automatically be added to the sitemap and so in effect what's going to happen
is we're going to be able to see the site map grow with more URLs when the
sitemap grows with more URLs then that means then Google is going to index more
pages they're going to index more fresh pages so they're going to be able to get those pages that are just published
quicker so that's the whole idea idea behind Dynamic site Maps is we want to
be able to capture all the URLs just as they're published and we want to be able to maintain our site maps and so I would
always recommend a dynamic site map but you can always create your own sitemap
just by going to a tool called XML sitemap so if I just type in XML
sitemaps into Google search here I can see XML sitemaps generator and I can be able if
I have a small website just create a free and simple site map on my own when
XML sitemaps creates it or your platform creates a dynamic sitemap either way the
sitemaps going to sit in the root directory and then what we want to do in turn is let Google know where that
sitemap is so in search console we want to be able to submit the sitemap so
you're going to add the site map you're going to let Google know where it is it should be in the root directory and it
should be called sitemap.xml and when you do that Google's going to be able to take those URLs and index them so we
could see we submitted 528 URLs Google index 521 so one thing about URLs here
is when we create a site map we're putting all your URLs in there we do not
add no index URLs in your site map when what that means is that any URL we don't
want Google to index we're just going to exclude from the sitemap okay so we want Google to take all the URLs we want
indexed and put them in the sitemap so according to edgy using sitemaps for SEO
can increase your website's visibility and help you get indexed why because what you're in fact doing is taking all
your URLs that you want index you're telling Google how often they're modified you're telling Google which
ones are important and you're submitting that to Google and so Google's going to be able to take all these URLs quicker
index them quicker and when they're index quicker you can get ranked quicker and when you get ranked quicker you can
get traffic quicker so that's the whole idea behind sitemaps so let's turn our attention to page speed now so when the
last factors for our website besides architecture making it secure and adding
site Maps is we want to take a look at how quick our Pages load here are some tips in order to optimize page speed
because ideally the quicker a page loads the more engaged the user is going to be if it takes a longer time for the page
to load all the elements of that page then what's going to happen is the user is going to get impatient maybe leave
the website all together or go to another page and so we want to be able to optimize images so any image that's
of large size in terms of megabytes we want to be able to optimize that compress the image so that's one way to
speed up page speed we want to use a simple website design you know HTML with
CSS or cascading style sheets just a simple design with simple a hierarchy
and website navigation structure so nothing fancy nothing complex just a
simple website design with optimized images we want to leverage browser caching and we want to upgrade the
server response by meaning all your files are sitting on the server so when somebody goes to web page the server is
serving up all of those files the images the text Etc and so we want the server
to respond as quick as possible so when it comes to page speed we can look at the factors affecting page speed and
Google analytics so if I go to Google analytics and I go under behavior and I
go under site speed and I go to overview I'm going to be able to see what my average load time is for my site and
ideally we want our pages to load as quick as possible so that means anything
under four seconds anything four seconds or higher and it's likely the end user
is going to leave the page there's a correlation BP between page load time and bounce rate and so what Google
actually does is give you speed suggestions so if we do have a page that loads slow we can just go to speed
suggestions in Google analytics and we go to speed suggestions then Google's
going to be able to tell us hey okay this particular page load fast this potato page loads slow and if it loaded
slow why is it loading slow so here we could see the home page of the example is loading on average of seven seconds
well if we look here they're going to give us some suggestions so if I click on this page speed suggestions it's
going to load a report and a tool called page speed insights and basically what
it's then going to do after it's done running is it's going to tell me all the ways in which I can optimize my pages
not only for desktop but also for mobile so here I can see for desktop or for
mobile I can look at some ways in which I can optimize it to increase page speed
for example sizing my images properly server response time reducing my server
response time avoiding multiple page redirects so there's a lot of opportunities that we can do to speed up
page load time and all that's found in page speed insights and all that's found within Google analytics so remember
optimizing code minimizing redirects optimizing your images upgrading your
server response and all of those are factors and so again you can go into analytics page speed insights and you
can see exactly what Google is recognizing as what's lowering or slowing down your page load time so
Google takes site speed as one of the most important ranking factors why because they're going to rank Pages not
only with high quality content that are relevant to the keyword queries but they want those pages to have a good user
experience so if somebody clicks on the page then the user should be able to see that content fairly quickly and so
that's why it's such an important factor so the quicker your pages load the chances of you ranking higher are going
to be better so according to web performance today Walmart as an example experience to decline in conversions so
what they did was looked at their page speed and when they looked at their page speed you'd be surprised what that did
just increasing it from one to four seconds or decreasing it basically increased conversion so there's always
going to be a correlation between how quick a page loads and how engaged the
user is because if it's users engaged they're going to stay on the site and if they stay on the site then their chances
of converting are going to be higher so just even one to two seconds increase
and Page low is low time will make a world of difference in terms of Engagement and conversions let's turn
our attention to off-site engagement so previously we talked about on-page
elements and website factors that are fact our rankings for search results but
we also need to turn our attention away from our website meaning what we do on our website and turn our attention what
we can do for our website off our website and onto other websites so that's offside engagement and so let's
look get an example so that ice cream recipes blog so we did everything we
possibly could we updated The Meta tags the title tag The Meta description we added H1 tags we've made sure the site
architecture was sound we submitted a site map we we made sure the page load
was good and fast so we did all the things we're supposed to do on our web
page but we're still not ranking well what do we need to do well we need to turn our attention away from our website
into other websites we call this off side or off page SEO and we need to
basically generate links from high quality sites back to our site so if
we've done everything we can on our own website and we're still not ranking where we want to be well then we need to
turn our attention to other websites and so if we turn our attention other websites and other websites that are
relevant other websites that are of quality uh other websites that have high
domain Authority then we're going to see an increase in rankings so it's just a
matter of getting quality links from quality websites that are relevant that's what's going to move the needle
on search after we've taken care of all the on-page elements so more backlinks
from high domain Authority results in higher rankings SEO is a combination
between what we do on our website meaning optimizing the page and making sure our website has good site
architecture and follows the best practices in terms of site maps and Page load then we need to turn our attention
to the backlinking to improve our domain Authority so according to backlinko
analysis offsite engagement is one of the most important elements for ranking
number one in Google so you can't just focus your attention on updating the title tag and making sure the pages load
fast you have have to turn your attention as well to getting back
lengths from high quality sites that's off-site engagement and so getting links
back links from multiple domains is vital it's vital because they bring referring traffic to your site they
bring credibility to your site but more importantly Google is going to recognize the relationship between these sites and
your website and if these sites that have backlinks or links pointing to your site and if they're of high quality then
we call that passing linkages so it's going to bring quality to you in terms
of organic search so if we look at an example if I do a search for banana
bread recipe they're 241 billion results for banana bread recipe Why did this
particular page from Simply Recipes ranked number one well we can turn our
attention to Moz and Maz has a report called link Explorer and so Moz link
Explorer report helps us identify our own page Authority our own domain
Authority and how many links we have from other quality websites so if I put
that particular URL into link Explorer and notice the URL here is short even
though it uses an underscore when it should use a hyphen it's still ranked number one and why because off page
elements help this page rank number one why their page Authority out of 100 is
58 their domain Authority out of 100 is 82. and what does that mean well that
means that they have a lot of good links from other domains of high quality they
have 824 linking domains to this one domain they have 3600 inbound links and
they're ranking for a lot of different keywords so if we scroll down we're going to be able to see kind of a
breakout the quality of websites that are linking to them so they have 19 domains with a domain authority of 91 to
100 linking to them they have 15 domains between the range of 81 and 90. so what
does that tell me between 15 and 19 that's 34 particular domains that are
very high quality linking to them and so we could see the breakout of the linking
domains we could see the top file links to the site and we can see the page Authority so the link Explorer report
gives us an overview of what pages are linking to ours and it also gives us an
idea of what our own page Authority and domain Authority are because domain Authority and Page Authority both need
to be high in order for us to rank on Google search in order for it to get high we need links from high quality
sites so that's the whole idea behind off-site engagement so some of the offset engagements our influencer
marketing meaning is there somebody out there on social who has a huge following but not only do they have a huge volume
but are they relevant to our product for example Usain Bolt who's a famous
Sprinter if we're selling shoes and we're selling Nike shoes maybe Usain
Bolt can reference us on Twitter or Facebook that's influencer marketing
getting people to influencing people to buy our product we can engage with
audiences on multiple social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter meaning if we're running a promotion on
those running shoes then we can promote that on Facebook okay we can promote that on Twitter we can also bookmark our
webpage on popular bookmarking sites like StumbleUpon we can also put our
content on discussion forums like Reddit we can join High PR quality q a sites
excuse me and post answers to questions related to our business is like quora.com so we can engage in sharing
our content and answering questions so there's lots of ways to get links to
your website if you have a blog post as an example you can make sure that maybe
that content is shared on a similar blog post so if you have an ice cream recipe
blog post well maybe you can look at a dessert blog post and share your content
on that particular blog post and have a back link pointing from that blog post
to yours as an example and you can reciprocate so the whole idea of content is sharing the content but at the same
time I've shared it you're producing backlinks and backlinks help domain Authority so not only did it help domain
Authority but they improve the search rankings so in Google's eyes the higher
your domain Authority higher the page Authority in Google's eyes that means your page is important it's credible and
we're going to improve it in the search engine rankings it increases brand visibility if we have our content on a
highly engageable website a highly popular website or blog it's not it's
going to lift our brand visibility if we have Usain Bolt who's very famous Sprinter do some influence in marketing
for us then that's going to increase our brand visibility so anytime we can associate with something that has some
influence or some clout or high domain Authority then it's only going to increase our brand awareness and
visibility so again it's going to increase our domain Authority because of the association of passing link juice
from one domain to another it's going to then as a result increase referral
traffic because if we're on a high quality website that gets a lot of traffic then the chances of some of that
traffic going our site is going to be great and again it improves The credibility and Trust of our website and
that's what we want we want Google to trust us and a way to build trust is by by associating our website with other
websites of high equal or higher quality so when we talk about off-site engagement we want to do some guest
posts on relevant websites so if you have that ice cream blog go to another blog like the dessert blog and do a
guest post so not only that will that improve your brand awareness but it'll
generate a backlink and maybe drive some referral traffic you can participate in forms and blog discussions like core.com
or Reddit get your content out there start a discussion about a specific topic to engage users build brand
awareness and generate that backlink you can always you know put your your site
on a directory like Yelp for example or Yahoo directory you could prefer
testimonial link building meaning if you serve products or offer up a service well somebody can provide a testimony on
their website or you can just earn back links from relevant authoritative web pages like we mentioned quora or
Wikipedia or there's plenty out there so the idea is to associate yourself with
high quality websites but do it naturally you don't want to force anything so if you're selling a specific
service or you're selling a specific product look for like mining services or products that complement what you do and
that'll create the natural environment natural ecosystem that will eventually
give you the benefits that you need to rank higher in the search results pages so we don't want to purchase any links
we don't want to cloak content we don't want to just inject links on sites that
aren't relevant we don't want to just have site-wide links all over the place pointed to the same page and we
certainly don't want to be on low quality websites or directories it's all about quality not quantity with off-site
engagement so having an offside engagement complements what you do on your website for on-site to gather both
of the those efforts will get you higher search engine results let's
measure your SEO performance so all that hard work you've done with on-page SEO
coupled with all the work you've done with off page SEO are eventually going to net results and positive results and
we want to be able to measure that as you're actually doing the work as you're putting forth the effort on on page and
off page and so we want to be able to measure that and so you want to be able to understand what to measure and where
to measure it and so when we talk about SEO we really want to hone in on three
high level core metrics and that's ranking traffic and conversion so when we talk about ranking traffic and
How To Measure Your SEO Performance
conversion we can break that down into this list here what kind of traffic are
we getting from organic search what kind of traffic are we getting from mobile devices remember mobile is very
important because as we talked about with on page SEO as we talked about with local SEO a lot of searches start with
mobile devices we want to look at keyword ranking remember keyword research is the first step in the SEO
process even before we do any work with on-page and off page you know we want to look at the local visibility if we have
local SEO results we want to look at engagement metrics so all that traffic we're driving from organic search we
want to be able to measure how they're performing and behaving on our website we also want to measure some form of
progress on off-page SEO and that's in the form of backlinks so all of these
are different metrics we can measure using different tools so let's talk about how to go about looking at these
metrics and where to go look at them and measure them and so really monitoring
all this Behavior will help us understand how we're performing how SEO is performing and so really what we want
to do is start with Organic traffic and so we can look at that on a
month-to-month basis we can look at it from a geographic perspective we can look at it in terms of how many new
visitors we're driving versus returning and then again more importantly conversion rate and so to me the best
place to start to look at that traffic from organic search is Google analytics
and Google analytics is a free tool it's simply there to measure website
performance so if you go into Google analytics we can actually go in and we
can look at all sorts of data based on website behavior and so if I'm in Google
analytics and I go under acquisition and then I go under all traffic channels
over a given period of time let's just say the last seven days for particular
website I can see what traffic is coming from organic search and then I could see the amount of new users that are coming
from organic search I can also see engagement metrics bounce rate for example so I want to be able to see if
somebody's typing in a query clicking on our Link in the organic search results
and then coming to our website are they actually engaging with their website or are they leaving the website after only
visiting the page they landed on so that's all in these are all important metrics to measure and I can measure all
that right here in Google analytics if I wanted to I can even take it a step further and break that down by country
so if I type in country as a secondary Dimension now I can see what country is
driving traffic from organic search so a lot of your organic traffic information
is going to be centrally located in Google analytics so we also talked about Mobile Traffic a majority of searches
take place on mobile phones versus desktop so Google basically is reporting
the nearly 60 percent of searches now appear from mobile devices and so if we
go back to Google analytics we can also look at a mobile report so if I go in
Google analytics under audience under mobile overview I can see a breakdown of
the amount of traffic coming from desktop versus tablet versus mobile and
so you'll find as time goes on that your mobile device is likely going to drive a
majority of the traffic from organic search and so you can compare device information with channel so if I just
type in Channel and Google analytics as a secondary Dimension and look at the default Channel groupings versus device
category I could see that you know mobile from organic search is driven traffic over the last seven days this is
something you want to keep an eye on because a lot of people tend to begin
their searches on mobile devices so mobile ranking is different than desktop
ranking because with mobile ball ranking it's based on a responsive website and
with that responsive website basically response of being that the website's going to adapt to the mobile device so
it's going to respond to the device that somebody's on and so therefore the metrics or the engagement metrics are
going to be different but if I look back to Google analytics I can see again
bounce rate I can see pages per session average session duration so if I look at
line three I could see all the different engagement metrics compared to those
metrics from other devices and other channels okay so you want to be able to do a comparison because if behavior is
not up to par engagement is not the par on mobile then you want to do something about that so you want to hone in on
Mobile Traffic specifically from organic search because the behavior is going to be different you know people start their
searches on mobile the site's going to be different and so therefore it's a different experience altogether so make
sure you track the behavior and more importantly make sure you track that page speed so earlier we talked about
on-page SEO when we honed in on page speed so this is a reminder if I'm back
in analytics and I go back under Behavior then if I go to site speed then
if I go to overview I'll be able to see the average page load time on my website
I can also look at specific page timings and I should be able to see that by device so if I type in device category
I'll just be able to see how each page loads per device and so this allow me to
understand which pages are loading fast which pages are not loading as fast and
address those pages accordingly to improve engagement metrics so we want to keep an eye on page speed as well as
overall user behavior from mobile devices you can also use other tools that are out there like agency analytics
their plan plenty of tools out there I tend to use Google analytics because primarily it's free and Google analytics
is a Google product so it works with other Google platforms like Google search console we want to keep an eye on
ranking so remember when we do our keyword research we're choosing keywords
that have high relevancy high volume and low competition so we want to be able to
track keywords that we choose that have high relevancy high volume and low
competition and so the tool we use or at least I recommend using is Moz so I
mentioned Moz earlier with on page and off-page SEO so if we go into Moz and we
know what keywords we're trying to rank for we can go ahead and add the Namaz and what Moz does they actually track
where these keywords Rank and so if I go into Mods and I click on rankings I'll
be able to see on a weekly basis or a monthly basis how our key keywords are
ranking and for what page is the ranking so for whatever keyword I choose to to optimize for I want to make sure I put
those keywords in Moz because when I put them in Moz Moz is going to on a weekly basis tell me where these keywords Rank
and for what URL they're ranked for so that way I can keep an eye on ranking
over time because in theory the higher you rank the more traffic you're going to get and so we want to be able to see
the trend in which keywords rank okay so if I click on a particular keyword in Moz it's going to give me over a period
of time where that keyword's ranked be able to see Improvement in ranking for a particular keyword the whole idea behind
SEO is to choose keywords that are relevant optimize for those keywords so that you can be ranked for those
keywords in order to get the traffic and conversions so Moz is a good platform that helps us monitor rankings for
particular keywords now if you don't want to use Moz as an alternative you
can turn your attention to Google search console and so remember we talked about Google search console earlier when we
talked about sitemaps we also talked about mobile usability with search console we also talked about links to
your site with Google search console so Google search console is a good tool to
help you understand how you're performing with Organic search and so there's one tool in particular which is
performance that helps us understand what keyword queries people are actually
typing into Google search and so here I could see the actual query and so with
this particular website valleyfig.com I can see that dried fig recipes over the
course of the last three months had 5414 Impressions that means that one of
my pages either one or multiple Pages appeared in Google search engine results
5414 times and over the course of those 5414 Impressions I received 1100 clicks
so Google search console is going to be able to tell me not only you know how
many Impressions I received for a particular keyword but they also going to tell me how many clicks and if I
wanted to add more metrics to that I can add them like the average ranking
position for keyword the click-through rate so I can add multiple metrics to this report to give me an understanding
of hey or any of my target keywords being used or queried and if they are
where am I ranking and I am I showing up and am I getting clicks so search
console serves as a good alternative if not primary tool or platform for you to
measure how your organic search results are showing so for local visibility this
metric is important for you know maintaining local SEO so remember on the
local SEO we talked about Google my business so if I go back to Google my
business I can go into my account and so Google my business is going to be able to show me some metrics so if I go into
Google my business and I click on insights I'm going to be able to see a number of different metrics over the
course of a month I can see exactly you know what queries were used by how many
users and when I appeared so I'll be able to see how many views I receive not
only on search results but on maps then I can also see what actions people took
when they saw my results in maps or on search did they visit my website did they request directions did they call so
I can actually see engagement metrics right in Google my business I could see a Breakout by ZIP code I could see phone
calls by day of the week I could see how many people even viewed my photos so there's a lot of insights into local SEO
on Google my business so that gives you an idea of how you're performing organically on local search and remember
you want to be able to use Google my business to hone in on your specific
audience so all these metrics help you align with whether you're getting in
front of the Right audience and whether that audience is actually behaving the way you want them to meaning you know
are they actually contacting you are they going to your website are they calling you so local visibility and
understanding the metrics involved with local SEO is very important so Google my business is where you want to turn your
attention so overall engagement metrics are important they play an important role in determining rankings for example
we talk about bounce rate so bounce rate is the rate at which people go from organic search to your website and then
leave after a scene one page and not going any further so if they land on a
page and then leave the website after landing on that page it's considered a bounce and so bounce or bounce rate is a
good indication of how people are receiving our website or the content
that they're reading on our website there are other metrics involved like average session duration or pages per
visit all of these are engagement metrics and let's not forget about page speed so page speed is also a good
engagement metric all of these metrics affect or determine rankings so we want
to be able to make sure that if we're in Google analytics and we're looking at engagement metrics that our metrics are
good because if somebody comes to our website from organic search and there's a high bounce rate then what does that
tell us that there's a disconnect between what that person's querying and then the content that they're reading
and so we want to be able to address those engagement metrics so that we can continue to not only drive quality
traffic but keep the traffic engaged and then in turn drive up conversions last
metric we want to look at is backlinks so content having more backlinks from
good domains will effectively improve your SEO performance we talk about
backlinks with off-page SEO and remember quality over quantity and so we can
measure backlinks going back into Moz we can use moz's Link Explorer tool so
remember if I type in a domain Valley fig I can get some metrics related
off-page SEO including my domain Authority but more importantly I can see
what links are pointing to my site in this case valleyfig.com so I can see
they're 575 link domains I can see there's 7900 inbound links and so just
by clicking on that I can get an idea of the types of websites that are linking
to my site and their domain Authority and their spam score Google search console so if you go back into search
console you can also just click on links and we should be able to get an idea of
you know what website sites are linking to our site and more importantly we want
to be able to see not only what sites but what pages they're linked to remember we want our backlinks pointing
to Interior Pages not necessarily the home page so here I could see the top link page for valleyfair.com it's slash
recipes so we want links pointing to our interior page is not necessarily the
home page that's what's going to help your performance your rankings for all
your pages not just your home page so having quality back links pointing to
Interior Pages help boost the domain Authority and the page Authority for that particular page so again using Moz
link Explorer tool or using the links report in search console are good
sources for you to identify backlinks so when we look at these these reports we
want to look at the Domain authority of these sites that are linking ours the number of outbound links to the site or
specific pages on our site we want to be able to look at the ratio of Link
distribution you know we want to be able to look at how many follows and no follows so most of this if not all of
these metrics are in Moz so if I go back to Moz I can actually see you know which
ones pointing which ones are followed the total quality of the link that's
pointing to our site again bam so Moz link Explorer report tends to give us
all the information we need in order to measure and get a sense of our backlinks that help us with off-page SEO so there
are other tools out there there's hrefs again search console there's other SEO
platforms out there that'll help you measure backlinks let's get started with
keyword research so basically what we want to do is Center our keywords just
like our website we want to Center our keywords around or our content around good keyword words so the videos on
YouTube are no different than the web pages on our website so if we have somebody who states YouTube is the
world's second most well well-known engine well it is because it's right behind Google it's not a search engine
per se it's a video platform but if it was a search engine it'd probably be
second right behind Google so YouTube is pretty popular majority people use
YouTube search every day to watch videos on a number of different topics so they can find these videos in Google but
because YouTube's so powerful and so popular people go directly right into YouTube for their searches and so the
whole idea behind YouTube being the second most well-known search engine is
centered around keywords so if you have the right keywords for your video then the chances of you ranking higher
increases on YouTube so we're gonna share with you a few easy ways to do
keyword research this is the the most important step in getting your videos to rank on YouTube just like for those of
you who watched any of the SEO videos we produced at simply learn you know that keyword research is so essential to
getting your web pages to rank on Google well it's no different keyword research and choosing the right keywords is just
as important for your videos as is for your web pages so we're going to go into a few things to do here to find the
right keywords so we have the search suggestion you can look at your competitors we have different tools we
can use some other factors involved in Google itself so let's start talking about some of these ways to really hone
in and do some good research on your keywords to align them with your videos the first thing is search suggest so
YouTube has a feature called autocomplete so if you've done any searches on Google it's very similar if
you're typing something in to YouTube search then YouTube is going to suggest
other related popular keywords so let's take a look at that if we go back to
YouTube for a second and I just type in machine learning YouTube is going to
populate on the autocomplete in the search bar some other popular keywords
that we can potentially use or in this case if I Choose You Know machine learning tutorial I'm going to see a
video about machine learning tutorial so here you can see simply learns ranked number one for machine learning tutorial
but there are other videos that show up in my search result so we want to be able to use the search suggestion box in
the search box field so when we're typing in something new YouTube just like on Google is going to give us those
suggestions so if we're focusing a video on machine learning then you know we have some ideas of some other keywords
that we could center around because these are our popular keywords these are key words that people are using to
search on YouTube so that's one suggestion looking at competitors is another suggestion so we could search
for keywords used by our competitors in their video and title and description so
let me talk a little bit about that what you want to do is you want to go to that particular channel of your competitor so
when you go to your particular competitors YouTube channel you want to be able to click on the videos tab when
you click on the videos tab then you're going to sort by most popular and then what you could do is see a list of
videos and then when you look at a list of videos you're going to choose a video and then what you're going to do then is
take a look at the keywords used in the title and description and then once you do that you're going to have a list of
keywords that you can use yourself for that video so for example let's go back
to YouTube so if I go to type in simply learn here's our Channel page just by
clicking on simply learn I click on videos ever wonder if there's so now I can see all the videos ever wonder if
there's an easier way go back so here I could see all the videos sort by most
popular once they do that then I can choose a video this is the most popular video right now for simply learn if I
click on that video it's automatically going to start playing but what I could do is simply just look at you know the
content description so just by clicking show more I can see all the content that
align with this video that's one way to do it is simply by looking at your
competitors now what you could also do is look at the tags associated with the
particular video and so what you want to do is you want to look at the HTML and
so that means looking at the page source so just like web pages what YouTube does is they look at meta tags so if you call
from SEO in order to get your pages to rank you need to have a title tag and a meta tag description so videos are no
different what we're doing for YouTube is aligning certain keywords with the
video so if you take a look and do a search for keywords by viewing the page
Source you're going to see all the keywords associated with a particular video so for example if I go back to
YouTube and I look at the page source of a video Let's just say this video here Facebook's ad tutorial I'm going to pull
up the page source and all I need to do is control F and type in keywords and now for that Facebook video I can see
all the keywords associated with the video so you can see there's a lot of
different keywords we're aligning with this video and so why do we want to do that because we want you know our video
to show up for keywords that people may type in and so if you use that YouTube autocomplete it's going to give you
those ideas this most popular keywords so if they're related align those keywords with the video so here you can
see Facebook marketing Facebook ad strategy Facebook ads for beginners so forth and so on so there's a lot of
keywords we've aligned here with that particular video you and again all you need to do is look at the page source so
right clicking view page Source do a control F for keywords and you'll be
able to see the keywords aligned so you could do that for your competitors videos as well so you can see what
keywords your competitors using for a video that's most popular for their
Channel and is also ranking on YouTube and on Google so using the autocomplete
gives you those keyword ideas looking at your competitors videos also gives you some other ideas for keywords that you
can align with a video that's relevant that you want to rank for so let's look at some other ideas here so you can
install plugins and there are plenty of plugins available on the Chrome browser that will help you see the video tags
associated with a particular video so a couple of examples are vid IQ and tubebuddy those are extensions that work
in Chrome and what they do is they give you the exact tags that a particular video is using so for example if I go
back here and I look at a video on YouTube let's just say the machine learning Basics video I have vid IQ
installed on my Chrome browser so just by clicking on that vid IQ is going to
give me a lot of information about that video you're just going to give me an overview of their particular metrics
they're going to give me some other information associated with Facebook some engagement metrics really what I'm
interested in is those keywords so if I scroll down a bit here I can see the
video tags associated with the machine learning Basics video so vid IQ is
telling me is these keywords are associated with this video and not only does it show me what keywords are
associated I can also see where they rank so for machine learning Basics this
particular video ranks number one if I go down I could see what is machine learning and how does it work I can see
it's rank number two here here I could see machine learning algorithms it's ranked number nine so I can get some
ideas of the types of keywords that are being used as tags for that video
further down I can also see some Channel tags but really this is the video tags or the idea place I want to be able to
look to get an idea of the types of keywords that are associated with the video that are also ranking or not
ranking so that's another way for you to really get an understanding of what
keywords to use of the particular video so autocomplete you can look at the page source of a competitors video or you can
use a Chrome extension in this case I'm using vid IQ to give me some information
about the video tags for a particular video so according to an industry study
using keywords and video tags will help you rank well on YouTube so you have to
use keywords and video tags if you want your video to rank there's been a lot of studies YouTube is so pop popular and
videos are so prominent in today's world where if you have videos and you're
going to upload them to YouTube then associate the right keywords with those videos so some important factors when we
look at keywords what we want to do is look at search volume we want to look at competition we want to look at relevancy
we want to look at the primary and secondary keywords that we want to use so well chosen keywords will help you
rank so we just gave you some ideas on how to do some keyword research again those ideas were really to use the
autocomplete on YouTube or Google they're going to give you some popular keywords you can look what your competitors are doing by looking at the
page source and just looking at the keywords that are aligned with that video or you can use a third-party
extension in Chrome in my example I use vid IQ that gave me the keywords
associated with that video so you have ways to get the keywords so what we want
want to do is we want to make sure we choose keywords with high search volume they're going to drive more traffic to
your video however we want to balance it out with keywords that have load difficulty and are easier to rank for so
you don't want to choose something very broad that's just going to be very difficult to rank for and of course we
always want to go with relevancy so for talking about machine learning Basics then we want to choose keywords
associated with that and that's where that autocomplete comes in handy because what Google's going to do and YouTube's
going to do is give us keywords that are very closely related to the video that
we're trying to optimize for and so we have a number of different keywords at our disposal that are relevant that we
can look to see if they have good volume and low competition and so the whole idea is we want to choose a keyword that
defines the nature of the content and then what we want to do is support that with secondary keywords so we want
keywords that are highly relevant to the primary keyword so that's the way to go about aligning your keywords you want keywords that are high volume low
competition or relevant and you want to choose that one keyword that is really what the content's about and then those
secondary keywords that support the primary so if you have a machine learning video you can choose your
primary keyword as in this case the machine learning Basics video so well chosen keywords help you rank well on
YouTube just like the machine learning Basics so if I go back to our video our machine learning Basics video if I just
type in machine learning Basics I'll be able to pull it up and so here it is if I click on it I'm going to go to YouTube
and so here I can see this keyword we know humans learn from is well aligned
because it's in the title it's in the copy and it's a line is a keyword tagged
with the video so we know that that keyword has good volume low competition is relevant because that's what the
video is about the basics of machine learning it's an introduction into machine learning so instead of honing in
on just introduction I mean machine learning primary keyword is machine learning Basics and then we supported
that video with those secondary keywords what is machine learning because somebody who doesn't know machine
learning is probably going to type in that keyword and then introduction to machine learning is a good secondary
keyword because it's explaining the basics of what machine learning is all about so primary keyword machine
learning basic secondary keywords what is machine learning an introduction to machine learning so that's the whole
idea behind choosing keywords you want that keyword that really is going to define the content and then support that
with those secondary keywords so remember when you're performing your keyword research choose keywords for
your videos that Google shows on the video results page so what I mean by that is your video can get more views if
you rank on Google as well so the whole idea is not necessarily to be found on YouTube it's also to be found on Google
Google so if I go back to Google and I just type in data science for beginners and I type in videos then you could see
we're ranked number one so even if you're not looking at the videos clicking on the videos link on Google
search you can always just when you do a search what Google's going to do is also put in the videos here on par as part of
the search results so what they're going to show you is the top videos that are ranking for that particular keyword and
so we may not rank overall for data science for beginners but we're ranked
number one in the videos category and so somebody's looking for a video that's important and you can see here that
these first two are ads so what Google is doing is they're saying hey this is so relevant this particular video for
the keyword query data science for beginners that we're going to show it above the organic listings even though
it's a video so the whole idea is to be found on YouTube and Google because
you're increasing your visibility you're increasing your chances of getting found on both search platforms so according to
backlinko google Ranks videos with keywords like how to tutorials so you
know a lot of the videos that you find on YouTube are going to be instructional based and so what Google's doing is
they're saying hey if somebody types in how to or tutorial or an introduction to
anything that's going to signal to Google that it's instructional it's going to help you rank so when you
search for machine learning tutorial or how to become a machine learning engineer you're going to get results
related to that because if you look at these examples we have machine learning tutorial in our title or how to become a
machine learning engineer so keep that in mind if you're creating a video and it's educational in nature you know use
those key terms like how to and tutorials in the video title because
that will help you rank so let's move over now out to video title so we want
to use our Target keyword in the title of the video and again we want to make
sure if it's educational to include that keyword tutorial or how to so for every
video title YouTube has a limit of a hundred characters so we really have to pick and choose really wisely so if we
look at the video that we were focusing on a couple of minutes ago so machine learning Basics here we could see under
100 characters we have machine learning Basics what is machine learning introduction to machine learning and
then the brand name so that is the title of this particular video so takes into
account the primary keyword the secondary keywords and the title and it also includes that really that key term
that really Google and YouTube like and that's what is machine learning so it's helping us Rank by having our keywords
in the title with that key phrase what is okay so that's a good tidbit on
creating a good video title is to align it with the right keywords your primary
and your secondary and so we want to use those catchy words and numbers to gain High click-through rates just like you
would on the title tag of your web page we want to do the same with our video title because the video titles what's
going to show up in search so if I go back to you know search here we could see you know data science tutorial data
science for beginners so we want to make sure in this case you can see data signs in five minutes so that was purposely
done so that hey I don't have time to watch a video I only have a couple minutes data science in five minutes
okay great I'm going to click on the video and now I have an opportunity to watch something and learn something under five minutes so choosing the right
words in your video title is going to help you get that click-through rate up remember clicked array is clicks divided
by Impressions and an impression is how many times your video shows up up and the search results on YouTube or Google
so we want to keep our click-through rate high and in order to do that we want to be able to write some really
good title tags for our video so use catchy words like a number or how to or
what is because that's going to resonate with people when they're searching now for the description what we want to do
is we want to use the target word at the beginning of the description the title
and the tags itself so if I go back to my video here machine learning Basics we
know it's in the video title and right off the bat if I look at the description of the video here I can see this machine
learning Basics video will help you understand what is machine learning so our primary keyword is in the first
sentence right in the introductory of the description and so that's going to bode well for optimizing our video the
description length is 5 000 characters so we have a lot of characters to work
with so if I go back to my video I click show more we have a lot of characters to
really describe what the video is about okay there's no shortage no shortage of
including keywords into the content so you have 5 000 characters go ahead and
see if you can work in naturally your keywords but one of the key tips here is
just make sure that first sentence starts out with that keyword that's a good tip of course you always want to
make it sound natural as possible you don't want to stuff it with keywords at the same time work them in naturally
work in your keywords naturally and then include hashtags in your description to help the audience find your video is
easily so if I go back here you know we want to be able to include hashtags so hashtags it's like anything else you
would use on social media it just signals to the end user hey this is what
the video is all about and if I go ahead and type in that keyword then it's our video has a better chance because it's a
line line with that hashtag and then there's Target keywords and LSI keywords
latent semantic indexing keywords we want to be able to use those keywords as
Target keywords with our video so if you recall the example I gave a few minutes ago we used the Facebook ads tutorial as
our example here I could see all the target keywords associated with that
particular video so don't be afraid to use those LSI related keywords meaning
keywords that are related to the content use them as Target keywords with the video so between your LSI keywords
Target keywords and then using our primary and secondary keyword in the
title tag using our primary and secondary keyword in the description and
then using hashtags in the description the combination of all of that if we chose the right keyword then we should
find that our video will eventually rank on YouTube so just just doing these
small tidbits with our keywords really help get our video to rank so at the end
of the day we want to be able to use the tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
looking at our competitors those extensions like vid IQ the autocomplete to really find our good keywords and
then incorporating those keywords into you know the title tag the description as Target keywords hashtags we should
really be off and running with our video on YouTube so at simply learn if I go to
YouTube and I just type in machine learning you could see we're right here is the first organic video on YouTube
for machine learning if I jump over to Google and I type in machine learning
Basics you can see where number or number one for machine learning Basics under videos if I click on all we're
also ranked here as well under the video section on organic search results another example data science for
beginners we ranked number one for that if I look at another keyword data science interview questions okay we're
ranked number two for that so we're ranking for a lot of videos and why are we ranking for a lot of different
content and videos on Google Search and on YouTube well we put a lot of work in
behind the scenes of creating the video and that's what we want to show you so part of that has a lot to do with you
know how our audience engages and sees our video so for example we're looking at a machine learning Basics video here
and we can see that it has over 221 000 subscribers for this video 234
000 views we've had over 2 000 people like the video and we have had over 270
plus comment on the video so when we get our videos to rank then we can see
there's a lot of Engagement and so that's the whole idea is when you do a video and you want to show up on YouTube
you want people to enjoy you want people to share it you want people to like like it you want people to comment on that
and that's part of the whole ecosystem of YouTube It's you know we're going to show you behind the scenes of what it
takes to get your videos to rank and then we're going to show you some of the metrics involved with some of these videos to help you stay ranking so
without further Ado let's go into how to get your videos to rank on YouTube so
we're going to talk about keyword research for YouTube we're going to talk about some ways to create high quality
videos to the importance of user engagement just as I showed you with the
machine learning Basics video all the shares all the commenting all the views and subscriptions then we're going to
get into how to promote your content and then we're going to just review a little checklist for you and sum it all up so
let's get started with keyword research so basically what we want to do is
Center our keywords just like our website we want to Center our keywords around or our content around good
keywords so the videos on YouTube are no different than the web pages on our our website so if we have somebody who
states YouTube is the world's second most well well-known engine well it is because it's right behind Google it's
not a search engine per se it's a video platform but if it was a search engine it'd probably be second right behind
Google so YouTube is pretty popular majority people use YouTube search every
day to watch videos on a number of different topics so they can find these videos in Google but because YouTube's
so powerful and so popular people go directly right into YouTube for their searches and so the whole idea behind
YouTube being the second most well-known search engine is centered around
keywords so if you have the right keywords for your video then the chances of you ranking higher increases on
YouTube so we're gonna share with you a few easy ways to do keyword research
this is the most important step in getting your videos to rank on YouTube just like for those of you who watched
any of the SEO videos we produced it at simply learn you know that keyword research is so essential to getting your
web pages to rank on Google well it's no different keyword research and choosing the right keywords is just as important
for your videos as is for your web pages so we're going to go into a few things
to do here to find the right keywords so we have the search suggestion you can
look at your competitors we have different tools we can use some other factors involved in Google itself so
let's start talking about some of these ways to really hone in and do some good
research on your keywords to align them with your videos so first thing is search suggest so YouTube has a feature
called autocomplete so if you've done any searches on Google it's very similar if you're typing something in to YouTube
search then YouTube is going to suggest other related popular keywords so let's
take a look look at that if we go back to YouTube for a second and I just type
in machine learning YouTube is going to populate on the autocomplete in the
search bar some other popular keywords that we can potentially use or in this
case if I Choose You Know machine learning tutorial I'm going to see a video about machine learning tutorial so
here you can see simply learns ranked number one from a machine learning tutorial but there are other videos that show up in my search result so we want
to be able to use the search suggestion box in the search box field so when
we're typing in something you know YouTube just like on Google is going to give us those suggestions so if we're
focusing a video on machine learning then you know we have some ideas of some
other keywords that we could center around because these are are popular keywords these are key words that people
are using to search on YouTube so that's one suggestion looking at competitors is
another suggestion so we could search for key words used by our competitors in
their video and title and description so let me talk a little bit about that what you want to do is you want to go to that
particular channel of your competitor so when you go to your particular competitors YouTube channel you want to
be able to click on the videos tab when you click on the videos tab then you're going to sort by most popular and then
what you could do is see a list of videos and then when you look at a list of videos you're going to choose a video
and then what you're going to do then is take a look at the keywords used in the title description and then once you do
that you're going to have a list of keywords that you can use yourself for that video so for example let's go back
to YouTube so if I go to type in simply learn here's our Channel page just by
clicking on simply learn I click on videos ever wonder if there's so now I can see all the videos I wonder if
there's an easier way go back so here I can see all the videos sort by most
popular once they do that that then I could choose a video this is the most popular video right now for simply learn
if I click on that video it's automatically going to start playing but what I could do is simply just look at
you know the content description so just by clicking show more I can see all the content that align with this video
that's one way to do it is simply by looking at your competitors now what you could also do is look at the tags
associated with the particular video and so what you want to do is you want to
look at the HTML and so that means looking at the page source so just like web pages what YouTube does is they look
at meta tags so if you call from SEO in order to get your pages to rank you need
to have a title tag and a meta tag description so videos are no different what we're doing for YouTube is aligning
certain keywords with the video so if you take a look and do a search for keywords by viewing the page source
you're going to see all the keywords associated with a particular video so
for example if I go back to YouTube and I look at the page source of a video Let's just say this video here
Facebook's ad tutorial I'm going to pull up the page source and all I need to do is control F and type in keywords and
now for that Facebook video I can see all the keywords associated with the video so you can see there's a lot of
different keywords we're aligning with this video and so why do we want to do that because we want you know our video
to show up for keywords that people may type in and so if you use that YouTube autocomplete it's going to give you
those ideas this most popular keywords so if they're related align those keywords with the video so here you can
see Facebook marketing Facebook ad strategy Facebook ads for beginners so
forth and so on so there's a lot of keywords we've aligned here with that particular video and again all you need
to do is look at the page source so so right clicking view page Source do a
control F for keywords and you'll be able to see the keywords aligned so you could do that for your competitors
videos as well so you can see what keywords your competitors using for a video that's most popular for their
Channel and is also ranking on YouTube and on Google so using the autocomplete
gives you those keyword ideas looking at your competitors videos also gives you some other ideas for keywords that you
can align with a video that's relevant that you want to rank for so let's look at some other ideas here so you can
install plugins and there are plenty of plugins available on the Chrome browser that will help you see the video tags
associated with a particular video so a couple of examples are vid IQ and tubebuddy those are extensions that work
in Chrome and what they do is they give you the exact tags that a particular video is using so for example if I go
back here and I look at a video on YouTube let's just say the machine learning Basics video I have vid IQ
installed on my Chrome browser so just by clicking on that vid IQ is going to
give me a lot of information about that video you're just going to give me an overview of their particular metrics
they're going to give me some other information associated with Facebook some engagement metrics really what I'm
interested in is those keywords so if I scroll down a bit here I can see the
video tags associated with the machine learning Basics video so vid IQ is
telling me is these keywords are associated with this video and not only does it show me what keywords are
associated I can also see where they rank so for machine learning Basics this
particular video ranks number one if I go down I could see what is machine learning and how does it work I can see
it's rank number two here I could see machine learning algorithms it's ranked number nine so I can get some ideas of
the types of keywords that are being used as tags for that video further down
I can also see some Channel tags but really this is the video tags or the idea place I want to be able to look to
get an idea of the types of keywords that are associated with the video that are also ranking or not ranking so
that's another way for you to really get an understanding of what keywords to use
at the particular video so autocomplete you can look at the page source of a competitors video or you can use a
Chrome extension in this case I'm using vid IQ to give me some information about
the video tags for a particular video so according to an industry study using
keywords and video tags will help you rank well on YouTube so you have to use
keywords and video tags if you want your video to rank there's been a lot of studies YouTube is so popular and videos
are so prominent in today's world where if you have videos and you're going to
upload them to YouTube then associate the right keywords with those videos so
some important factors when we look at keywords what we want to do is look at search volume we want to look at
competition we want to look at relevancy we want to look at the primary and secondary keywords that we want to use
so well chosen keywords will help you rank so we just gave you some ideas on
how to do some keyword research again those ideas were really to use the autocomplete on YouTube or Google
they're going to give you some popular keywords you can look what your competitors are doing by looking at the
page source and just looking at the keywords that are aligned with that video or you can use a third-party
extension in Chrome in my example I use vid IQ that gave me the keywords
associated with that video so you have ways to get the keywords so what we want
to do is we want to make sure we choose keywords with high search volume they're going to drive more traffic to your
video however we want to balance it out with keywords that have load difficulty and are easier to rank for so you don't
want to choose something very broad that's just going to be very difficult to rank for and of course we always want
to go with relevancy so for talking about machine learning Basics then we want to choose keywords associated with
that and that's where that autocomplete comes in handy because what Google's going to do and YouTube's going to do is
give us keywords that are very closely related to the video that we're trying
to optimize for and so we have a number of different keywords that are disposal that are relevant that we can look to
see if they have good volume and low competition and so the whole idea is we want to choose a keyword that defines
the nature of the content and then what we want to do is support that with secondary keywords so we want keywords
that are highly relevant to the primary keyword so that's the way to go about aligning your keywords you want keyword
words that are high volume low competition or relevant and you want to choose that one keyword that is really
what the content's about and then there's secondary keywords that support the primary so if you have a machine
learning video you can choose your primary keyword as in this case the machine learning Basics video so well
chosen keywords help you rank well on YouTube just like the machine learning Basics so if I go back to our video our
machine learning Basics video if I just type in machine learning Basics I'll be able to pull it up and so here it is if
I click on it I'm going to go to YouTube and so here I can see this keyword we know humans learn from is well aligned
because it's in the title it's in the copy and it's a line is a keyword tagged
with the video so we know that that keyword has good volume low competition is relevant because that's what the
video is about the basics of machine learning it's an introduction to machine learning so instead of honing in on just
introduction and machine learning primary keyword is machine learning Basics and then we supported that video
with those secondary keywords what is machine learning because somebody who doesn't know machine learning is
probably going to type in that keyword and then introduction to machine learning is a good secondary keyword
because it's explaining the basics of what machine learning is all about so primary keyword machine learning basic
secondary keywords what is machine learning and introduction to machine learning so that's the whole idea behind
choosing keywords you want that keyword that really is going to define the content and then support that with those
secondary keywords so remember when you're performing your keyword research choose keywords for your videos that
Google shows on the video results page so what I mean by that is your video can get more views if you rank on Google as
well so the whole idea is not necessarily to be found on YouTube it's also to be found on Google so if I go
back to Google and I just type in data science for beginners and I type in videos then you could see we're ranked
number one so even if you're not looking at the videos clicking on the videos link on Google search you can always
just when you do a search what Google's going to do is also put in the videos here on par as part of the search
results so what they're going to show you is the top videos that are ranking for that particular keyword and so we
may not rank overall for data science for beginners but we're ranked number
one in the videos category and so if somebody's looking for a video that's important and you can see here that
these first two are ads so what Google is doing is they're saying hey this is so relevant this particular video for
the keyword query data science for beginners that we're going to show it above the organic listings even though
it's a video so the whole idea is to be found on YouTube and Google because
you're increasing your visibility you're increasing your chances of getting found on both search platforms so according to
backlinko google Ranks videos with keywords like how to tutorials so you
know a lot of the videos that you find on YouTube aren't going to be instructional based and so what Google's
doing is they're saying hey if somebody types in how to or tutorial or an introduction to anything that's going to
signal to Google that it's instructional it's going to help you rank so when you
search for machine learning tutorial or how to become a machine learning engineer you're going to get results
related to that because if you look at these examples we have machine learning tutorial in our title or how to become a
machine learning engineer so keep that in mind if you're creating a video and it's educational in nature you know use
those key terms like how to and tutorials in the video title because
that will help you rank so let's move over now to video title so we want to
use our Target keyword word in the title of the video and again we want to make
sure if it's educational to include that keyword tutorial or how to so for every
video title YouTube has a limit of 100 characters so we really have to pick and
choose really wisely so if we look at the video that we were focusing on a couple minutes ago so machine learning
Basics here we could see under 100 characters we have machine learning Basics what is machine learning
introduction to machine learning and then the brand name so that is the title
of this particular video so it takes into account the primary keyword the secondary keywords and the title and it
also includes that really the key term that really Google and YouTube like and that's what is machine learning so it's
helping us Rank by having our keywords in the title with that key phrase what
is okay so that's a good tidbit on creating a good video title is to lie
line it with the right keywords your primary and your secondary and so we want to use those catchy words and
numbers to gain High click-through rates just like you would on the title tag of your web page we want to do the same
with our video title because the video titles what's going to show up in search so if I go back to you know search here
we could see you know data science tutorial data science for beginners so we want to make sure in this case you
can see data science in five minutes so that was purposely done so that hey I
don't have time to watch a video I only have a couple minutes data science in five minutes okay great I'm going to
click on the video and now I have an opportunity to watch something and learn something under five minutes so choosing
the right words in your video title is going to help you get that click-through rate up remember clicked array is clicks
divided by Impressions and an impression is how many times your video shows up and the search results on YouTube or
Google so we want to keep our or click-through rate high and in order to do that we want to be able to write some
really good title tags for our video so use catchy words like a number or how to
or what is because that's going to resonate with people when they're searching now for the description what
we want to do is we want to use the target word at the beginning of the description the title and the tags
itself so if I go back to my video here machine learning Basics we know it's in
the video title and right off the bat if I look at the description of the video here I can see this machine learning
Basics video will help you understand what is machine learning so our primary keyword is in the first sentence right
in the introductory of the description and so that's going to bode well for optimizing our video the description
length is 5 000 characters so we have a lot of characters to work with so if I
go back to my video I click show more we have a lot of characters to to really
describe what the video is about okay there's no shortage no shortage of
including keywords into the content so you have 5 000 characters go ahead and
see if you can work in naturally your keywords but one of the key tips here is
just make sure that first sentence starts out with that keyword that's a good tip of course you always want to
make it sound natural as possible you don't want to stuff it with keywords at the same time work them in naturally
work in your keywords naturally and then include hashtags in your description to help the audience find your video is
easily so if I go back here you know we want to be able to include hashtags so hashtags it's like anything else you
would use on social media it just signals to the end user hey this is what
the video is all about and if I go ahead and type in that keyword then it's our video has a better chance because it's a
line with that hashtag and then there's Target keywords and LSi AI keywords
latent semantic indexing keywords we want to be able to use those keywords as
Target keywords with our video so if you recall the example I gave a few minutes ago we used the Facebook ads tutorial as
our example here I could see all the target keywords associated with that
particular video so don't be afraid to use those LSI related keywords meaning
keywords that are related to the content use them as Target keywords with the video so between your LSI keywords
Target keywords and then using our primary and secondary keyword in the
title tag using our primary and secondary keyword in the description and
then using hashtags in the description the combination of all of that if we chose the right keyword then we should
find that our video will eventually rank on YouTube so just doing these small
tidbits with our keywords really help get our video to rank so at the end of
the day we want to be able to use the tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
looking at our competitors those extensions like vid IQ the autocomplete to really find our good keywords and
then incorporating those keywords into you know the title tag the description as Target keywords hashtags we should
really be off and running with our video on YouTube that's our turn our attention to creating high quality videos and some
of the best practices around that so along with everything we mentioned about choosing the right keywords we always
need to keep in mind that the videos we create need to be of high quality so the
content itself in addition to the keywords is a primary factor in ranking so in order to have keywords we need to
have content and in order to rank we need to have you know good content so let's talk a little bit about creating
content and what's involved with that and what we really mean by high quality videos so if you have a video content
that is not informative or irrelevant to the topic it won't rank so that's just
common sense so you need to create content that's aligned with the topic obviously and then that way you have
keywords that are aligned with the content so but if you have content it really isn't aligned with the topic then
you're not going to rank no matter how much you've optimized that video so just keep that in mind so there's a couple of
things we want to look at here so high quality content is determined by really two metrics so if we're not sure about
how good our content is and how good of high quality video we created we want to
look at audience retention and user engagement so audience retention is
simply the percentage length of your video that the audience has watched It's the percentage your audience has watched
so focusing on audience retention is important for people who want their videos to rank high so if you want to
rank you need to optimize for the keywords but got to keep in mind content so content is related to audience
retention and user engagement so audience retention percentage length your video of your video that the
audience has watched and for example it can be both absolute in minutes or
percentages so audience retention can be the average view duration or percentage
of the audience that watched then we have user engagement so yours engagement of viewers who are engaged with your
content and so that means they're either sharing it subscribing commenting or liking so those are all forms of
Engagement so the percentage of users who watched or how long they watched
versus engagement or in combination with engagement are two factors for ranking
so let's talk about some tips for creating high quality videos so we want to publish longer videos and so so what
do we mean behind longer videos so what's the reason for longer videos let's just suppose we have two videos
one shorter in length and one longer in length first video is 15 minutes long the second video is seven minutes long
so on average if you viewers watch about 40 of both videos then video x which is
15 teams long will have more than twice the watch time of the video that's seven
minutes long so remember duration we want you know people to watch our videos
longer so if the video is longer in length if it's 40 then it's gonna have a
longer audience engagement audience retention so that's one of the reasons you know from a metric standpoint so
even when viewers watch you know both videos the time is going to differ so we
want to take into account longer videos for primarily that region is because you
know it gives an end user an opportunity to watch the video longer and then it's going to help us rank our videos longer
so when we talk about watch time so if one video has higher watch time than the
other watch time is just the number of views times the average view duration so
another tip is we want to plan our video script so we want to keep the content
organized my recognition is you know create an outline first and once you create an outline of how the video is
going to flow then start populating with content and so to me that's how you can
keep the flow organized okay is really with an outline starting out with it on
how there's no videos are no different than say a presentation if you've done a PowerPoint presentation you always want
to start out doing an outline and then we want to upload a high resolution videos high resolution we don't want to
create videos that you know are small resolution like say you know 400 by 400
resolution or something you know something really small we want to create something a very high res so according
to back or link Oaks more than 50 of videos on the first page of YouTube are
high definition so high definition videos of higher quality are going to be
shown on the first page of YouTube more often than not so high resolution videos
organizing the content publishing longer videos are examples of of creating high
quality video we also want to make sure that content is relevant to the title so
if we're talking about machine learning Basics you know obviously the content is going to be about you know intro to
machine learning or what is machine learning and then the title should reflect that content so aligning the
title sets the expectation for the end user so when they see a title what is machine learning then when they watch
the video they're expecting to learn about machine learning and what it is so
if it meets expectations then the chances are that person who's watching the video is going to watch it longer
and that means it's going to fulfill the viewers requirements and when you align
everything accordingly keywords titles content then at the end of the day the
user is going to watch it and the more they watch it the higher the engagement the higher the engagement the better
chance you have to rank some other tips that you could use to create high quality videos so we want to be able to
you know use examples to clarify our content so you don't be afraid to go into another screen like I am if I want
to I'm talking about videos jump into the machine learning Basics video which I've done throughout this session I can
simply do that by keeping the user engaged here this video is about machine learning Basics well the titles online
with the video we made sure that we have a nice description about what the video
is about and we're aligning the expectations so not only that I'm showing you example within the video
itself so we want to use examples throughout your video to keep the user engaged it will also help clarify what
you're trying to express in the video itself so we want to make it visually appealing so visually appealing means
imagery or examples in the video and then when we talk about imagery you know
you want to use good images in your video so use public domain sites that
are available able to like Shutterstock or flat icon I mean there are plenty of those sites out there so feel free to
use any one of those sites to use high quality images in your video give more
information to your audience okay giving maximum relevant information can help gain more views and so when we talk
about more information again it goes back to you know the examples you use there's no should be no shortage of
examples here description use all 5 000 characters at your disposal imagery we
want to build up as much information as you can in the video itself to keep the end user the viewer engaged we also want
to create original content so always create original content you could certainly get ideas from YouTube if you
want to create a video about machine learning see what else has already been done do searches on YouTube itself but
you know when you're going to create a video yeah you can create another video about what is machine learning but just
make sure it has your own take on it you're the subject matter expert when creating the video create it with your
own original content have high audio quality and video effects so just like
you see here on this video we have effects in it and the audio is of high quality meaning no background noise no
Distortion and we want to be able to speak clearly in the video so you want to speak clearly loudly concise just as
I'm trying to do now so that you can understand what I'm trying to say or what the viewer is trying to to
understand when they're watching the video so watching and listening are two of the components and you want to make
sure both of our high quality avoid distractions we don't want to pause you don't want to ramble on a particular
Point too long we want to keep users engaged so you always want to move from one point to the other intermix it with
examples those are ways to keep the users engaged we want to include transcripts or subtitles for your video
so transcripts is just more content that's all line with the video and the
search engines will be able to pick up that content and help your video rank so to me that's a key component to creating
a good video is having the necessary content that go along with the video that outline I referenced earlier in
terms of organization you always want to have a Content outline so what topics are you going to cover in the video
that's why you need the outline to point that out confirm that before you actually start creating the video okay
focus on the initial 15 seconds so that's key you know somebody's going to click the play button of your video and
if you don't catch them in the first 15 seconds then they're likely going to pause the video or just go ahead and
close it out altogether so you want to be able to capture somebody's attention right off the bat and even before they
click on that play button you want to make sure again you're exceeding expectations that title is aligned with
the content so in your first 15 seconds it basically needs to be catchy but also
setting the X expectation of what the user is expecting so in this example here we want to pay close attention to
the first 15 seconds that's when viewers are most likely to drop off so we can
look at audience retention and YouTube so use the options above the graph to view absolute audience retention or
relative audience retention so audience retention is basically how many views a
video received and the percentage of the total number of video views and that includes every moment of the video as a
percentage so we'll show you an example of what that looks like so here if we go to the machine learning Basics video we
can look at the audience retention report and this is since it's been uploaded the lifetime audience retention
so here we can see a nice graph the percentage of people who viewed it and how long they viewed it so in percentage
so here for example I can see you know 43 44 watch the video for at least two
minutes here I can see 28.6 percent wash it for six minutes plus so that's the
audience retention it gives us an idea in terms of percentage how many people or percentage of people watch the video
at what length so that's audience retention so we want to keep that number high at the very initial stage of the
video and we want to keep it high throughout and that's why you always want to create high quality content using those examples using imagery
making it organized content not pausing you know going from one point to the
other those are all best practices to keep the viewer engaged and then we want
to add resources from well-known sites so throughout this video we've used backlinko there are other sources we've
used so if you have a source go ahead and put it in your video to add credibility and then we want to use cards to your videos so this cards is
basically a feature that recommends relevant videos to your audience so in addition to machine learning Basics
there could be other videos about machine learning that we can recommend or use two can recommend to the audience
to set up end screens you want to make sure that with end screens you can use
relevant videos to your audience towards the end of your video so you can recommend relevant videos towards the
end of your video you can also create playlists so this is a feature that keeps your audience engaged with
relevant content by Auto playing the next video so if you enable this feature
it's going to go from one video to another pattern interrupts keep the audience engaged so basically it allows
for your audience to stay within one video without having any interruptions involved and so going back to the did
you know audience retention report helps you analyze how well your videos are engaging to the audience so what do we
mean by that well if I go back again to my audience retention report how engaging was it well I could see 42
percent 43 percent watched it on average of 3 minutes and 21 seconds so to me
that's pretty good of course we always want a hundred percent of the video the video is seven minutes long if almost
half of our audience saw over half of the video then I would say that's pretty
good people were engaged so audience retention just is a good report to start looking at to help you understand how
engaging is my video and if your video is not engaging you know you can always go back and edit it or fix it or tweak
it so remember the average view duration for all videos and top performing videos
listed by all time we can look at that information as well in addition we can look at demographics so we can get an
overview of the age gender and location and we can look at playback locations report and what the playback locations
report does is it helps us determine the platforms where our videos are being streamed from within YouTube look at the
traffic sources where did the viewers come from devices did they look on mobile or tablet and so if there's any
doubts you know if you have any questions please drop a comment below but especially if you have any doubts on
the metrics so if we go back into YouTube we can look at analytics and if we're looking at analytics we can see
more and then this is going to show us everything we need to see from device type so if I click on more I can see my
playback location so this will show me where the video is watched it was on a
watch page or a channel page I could see the traffic sources I could see the
gender and age so if I click on the viewer age report I can see the percentage of views by age so I can get
a lot of information about my video and how it's performed who's watched it what they've done with
it where they come from all the information they need to know okay so it's all within YouTube analytics so
again if you have any questions about that you know just drop a comment below especially if you're new to YouTube you
may have some questions but just know that every video you published to YouTube high quality align with your
keywords you're going to be able to view the metrics by looking at YouTube analytics so let's talk about the
importance of user engagement so engagement is as we mentioned important
because basically we can't rank without engagement our videos won't rank unless
we have engagement so that's why it's important so engagement is somebody liking the video commenting sharing it
or subscribing each one of these is important to ranking so yes you need to
line keywords yes you need to have high quality content so when you do both of
those and you upload your video then it's up to the viewer and so the hard
work that you put out for the video is hopefully going to pay dividends with engagement so you want people to do one
of these four okay so let's talk about what that means so how do I get engagement so we already talked about
creating engaging content so there are a lot of tips to creating engaging content
and so according to wordstream if your content is entertaining then over three
quarters of the users are going to share it so that's part of keeping uh users engaged is keeping it entertaining is
part of getting a high quality video so remember on that high quality video when we say entertaining the audio portion
has a lot to do with it examples has a lot to do with it quality of the video itself has a lot to do with it so a lot
of components so all those components on a high quality video are going to lead to engagement so parts of what you could
do in your videos is conduct a quiz so meaning the quiz itself is a way to keep
people engaged in your video so that also help you get some more comments so according to backlinku video comments
help and rank in your video higher so just as I mentioned the last segment about YouTube analytics and all the
different different reports available on YouTube hey if you have questions on those just go ahead and add a comment so
that's a way to entice your users or your viewers to add comments is if they
have questions because you know with videos you're not going to be able to cover every detail or every minute
detail about a particular topic you can only cover in some cases the topic at a
high level so users are going to have comments or questions naturally and so
the comment section is a good way to remind viewers hey if you have a question or comment go ahead and put in
the comment section because that will lend to engagement as well so we want to add sources from high quality websites
that'll help with engagement okay use humor in your video we want to be able
to basically you know make it human based we don't want to be robots so we
want to be able to sound like you know we know what we're talking about but at the same time talk to the viewer not
know necessarily at the viewer or looking the other way and just going through the motions so adding humor
adding personality never hurts at the end of the day we are all human adding that clear call to action at the end of
the video will also lead to engagement so if we win the video with hey leave
your comments on this video or hey feel free to share this video with colleagues who are interested then that's a call to
action that's likely going to lead to more engagement reply to your comments as well so if you have comments we
always want to reply to them likely those comments are going to be questions because again as I mentioned even in
this video about how to rank your videos on YouTube okay there's a lot of information and a lot of information
sometimes doesn't get covered in its entirety and so we want to make sure
that if we miss something because we're only human that we're able to respond in the form of an answer to a question that
somebody leaves in the comments section so more comments also lead to higher rankings because it's engagement so when
you're getting high engagement and your video starts to rank well you know you're going to start feeling really good and what is that going to do look
at that feel good is going to lead to confidence which in turn is going to probably lead to more videos and that's exactly what we do at simply learn I
mean we're in the education business but we're in it to not only educate but making sure that our videos are shown to
as many people as possible so that we can educate as many people as possible so it's all it's contagious so getting
ranked feels good and then once you get ranked then you know you probably have good engagement okay let's talk about
how to promote your content so once you've done all the hard work getting
your video done high quality content optimized with keywords and then publish
to YouTube we want to let everybody in the world know about it right so we want to promote it we've done all the work we
want to promote it now so is it necessary to promote it I would say yes because once your video is published
fish you want to reach out you want to reach out to your audience not necessarily on YouTube but on different
platforms so if you're active on Facebook or Twitter that's an opportunity for you to post or tweet
something about the new video so when we say different platforms I am talking about you know social media platforms so
it depends on what you're active on so if you're active on Facebook yeah go ahead and post some of you're active on
Twitter go ahead and tweet something it could be you know on LinkedIn group if you're part of a LinkedIn group about
you know machine learning then go ahead and post something to that group to promote the video so that's going to
help Drive traffic to the video and then help with engagement so we want to engage with our audience on those social
media sites so it really depends on what you're active on so if you have a large following on Twitter then go ahead and
you know share that YouTube video link on Twitter with the Tweet that's going to drive traffic from Twitter to YouTube
Remember you know you're going to be able to see audience engagement or
retention by getting people to watch the video so you're going to be able to see right away by promoting the video and
driving traffic to the video how engaging it is remember the more people you have watched the video the more
engaging it becomes the better it's going to rank so it's an ecosystem and promoting your content is part of that
ecosystem so it all starts with social media if you're active on whatever
platform that is go ahead and promote it so you can also look at you know content
based social media sites or social media content based platforms like Reddit or
Flickr for example so you can participate in a forum discussion on Reddit so in this example here it's
about machine learning so we want to be able to post something about machine learning with the link to our video so
we can also go to content-based sites that are q a uh related like quora for
example Cora is a really good site where you know if you go there post information about machine learning or
the basics of machine learning with the link back to the video it's going to help because not only is it going to drive traffic but it's going to signal
to Google hey you get a lot of traffic coming from Cora this is going to bode well for this video in terms of ranking
so here's an example you know if you find a question that you can post on core then you're going to get people to
click on your video and respond accordingly on quora or you can act as the person responding to a question
that's already there so somebody already asked a question about what is machine learning you can respond with your video
as the answer so you can just simply embed your video URL as part of your answer that'll help Drive traffic so you
can also create your own blog and embed your video so in the case of machine learning here we have an example machine
learning what is it and why it matters so this goes nicely with the video so
here you can see the person the off author of this blog went ahead and embedded the relevant video in the blog
post so they play off one another nicely you can also opt in for influencer marketing meaning hey you can reach out
to somebody in this example here you know Katie nuggets posted information about machine learning so in this case
why choose machine learning as a career well they got information and then what do they do they went ahead and embedded
the video about machine learning Basics and so working with you know influencers
in a particular category or topic will help Drive traffic to the video you can
also create a YouTube playlist so playlists tend to rank high in YouTube searches so if you find yourself doing a
lot of videos we'll go ahead and you know go to your channel and simply on
your channel you can go ahead and create playlists so when you create playlists basically what you're doing is you're
organizing the content into different playlists no different than say the music you have set up on your you know
your iPhone or iPad or or iPod whatever it is you're using so you're just creating different videos in a
particular category and it YouTube likes it it's organized it's going to help you get your videos found quicker and easier
on YouTube Itself by putting your videos in a playlist so here you could see we
have entire playlist on machine learning trending Technologies cloud computing Big Data digital marketing project
management so a lot of different playlists very organized if somebody goes to the channel they're going to be
able to go to the playlist that's interesting to them and see all the videos there so it allows not only the
end user to find what they're looking for but it's good for YouTube because YouTube likes those playlists so we want
to engage our Audience by posting your video link on a community page so you could do that within YouTube and you can
prefer to link your YouTube channel in your email so you can also do that so for example if I go back to YouTube and
I'm looking at a YouTube video you know I can always Click Share so here I'm
gonna get a particular URL that's associated with the video and I can just
embed that so I can embed the whole thing in my email I can embed it on a web page or a blog post so just by
clicking share I can also immediately share it onto the social media platforms
that we mentioned Facebook LinkedIn Reddit okay Tumblr so there's a lot of
ways to embed the video not just not a blog post or influencer blog post but in
our email and on social media as well so here's an example of what we can do with
the YouTube discussion so we can also bookmark the video on a popular bookmarking site you know like stumbled
upon or read it or you know there's lots of other ones out there so there's
plenty of sites that you'll be able to go to and bookmark Mark that content so
that people can find it and you can always opt for backlinks so that means that hey if there's a blogger out there
that blogs about machine learning you can always you know ask that blogger to create a link back to the video and you
could reciprocate do the same thing so that helps increase the authority of the video so a lot of things you could do to
promote your video so let's do a quick review on everything we talked about in
terms of ranking your video on YouTube it all starts with the keywords so we want to identify a list of keywords that
are relevant to the video so we can use tools to choose our keywords but remember we want to choose keywords that
have high volume and low competition and so where can we go to choose those keywords well we can use the
autocomplete on YouTube we can check out our own competitors videos or you know
we could use vid IQ or tubebuddy or any of these extensions in Chrome to help us
look at the keywords that are tagged with a particular video so remember we want to have a primary keyword that's
aligned with the content then we want to choose LSI keywords as our secondary keyword or keywords that are related to
the primary keyword so we want to create high retention videos meaning that first 15 seconds of the most important but
throughout the video we want to use examples we want to keep it interacting by adding quizzes imagery good audio
good video quality so we want to focus on the user experience and we also want
to optimize our video content what does that mean well those keywords that we chose we want to use them in the title
we want to use them in the description we want to use them as hashtags we want to use them and tag them with the video
themselves so we can add keywords to our meta tag okay we don't want to overdo it but we want to add a handful of keywords
that are associated with the video so we want to be able to write I catchy video
titled and descriptions so remember use some of those key phrases like a number
or a question like what is machine learning so we want to use relevant meta
tags for the videos and we want to use popular YouTube tags so we want to be able to tag our videos appropriately to
watch the length of your meta tags so there are links involved remember keywords at the beginning of the title
Target keywords in the title description and tags we want to use interesting thumbnails to increase our click-through
rate ensure that thumbnails are relevant meaning when I say thumbnails I mean the actual title tag itself or The Meta
description we want to use hi-res videos we want to create you know videos with good high audio quality don't be afraid
to put in video effects like some animation don't be afraid to use examples and then you know obviously
look at the draft of the video before you publish it so does your video follow an outline is it organized so these are
all the things to take into account and there's there's plenty more you can do you know you remember once you create
How To Report SEO Campaign Metrics
and optimize that video you want to promote it you want to make sure that you're sharing it on social media you
create a complimentary blog you know generate backlinks from say other blog posts so there are lots of things you
can do to promote your video so before you promote it you want to organize the content create good quality content
align it with keywords once you publish it you know keep organizing it by
creating those playlists and then reach out on social reach out on different communities related to the topic and all
those things combined will help you to get your YouTube video ranked so again some key takeaways here use the keyword
research Available to You on YouTube you want to basically you know watch your
descriptions you want to be able to align your keywords with your title and meta tag description you want to be able
to promote your content on social media on social bookmarking though and I can't
stress enough create a high quality video first 15 seconds are important but you're going to know if you have good
quality video because every video has analytics associated with it so we want
to keep in mind the engagement so just by looking at the video itself so here I
can see this blockchain in seven minutes it was just posted just yesterday the
27th so basically already 42 likes 33 comments 378 views so these are all
engagement related metrics so you'll be able to just look at the front of any video and see how well it's performing
from an engagement standpoint so the better the engagement the better you of a chance you have to rank now when we're
talking about the trends there are significant shifts happening in organic
search the first of which is machine learning uh that is more artificial
intelligence analyzing search queries and and developing new algorithms within
the machine learning to serve up results determine intent which is the primary
goal of machine learning and to return not only the results but the information
you need as well as predicting information you might need in the near
future the second is voice search more and more voice assistance are becoming popular
through your smartphone through your laptop through home assistance and people are asking for information and so
it is completely happening at an auditory level not in visual level and
so how that is happening and how that affects SEO reporting is really going to
be a factor moving forward and then also as I'm sure if you've been doing any search engine optimization for any
length of time you are familiar with the struggle uh that has happened ever since
Google decided to strip keyword data out of any analytics reporting that took
away really the number one way that you were able to measure the effectiveness
of gaining keywords in the search engines now to hit each one of these just to
explain them a little bit more so that you know exactly what's happening and what it looks like as it affects your
current level of SEO work as well as reporting uh as an example of machine
learning uh if you go into Google AdWords right now and you were to set up
a campaign looking at maybe like auto body or Auto work or something like that
if you typed in a few keywords into Google what's happening is Google is
only reporting one phrase that might cover two or three or four phrases based
on for example Auto Body being is it one word or is it two words Google here is
providing it as two words so even if I type in auto body as a single word this
is where the machine learning is coming in realizing that these are the same queries and so rather than treat them as
individual queries what is happening is through machine learning is they are trying to figure out what is the intent
of the search and then grouping the intent into single categories or single
searches and then all the variations would be included in that now if I do
keyword research at a third party such as word tracker or something like that
now what I'm going to find are multiple different ways that people search uh
they're going to put in locations they're going to put in details they're going to you know use one word two words
and so in a third party keyword research format we're going to see a lot more
variations because those are tracking what people are actually typing in what Google is doing from the machine
learning standpoint is condensing everything and trying to group it into as I said similar forms of intent
now What's Happening Here It means that phrases or words that are plurals
acronyms typical variants uh
such as words that may mean the same thing uh but then they're different words so they're going to group them
together uh and then also as you saw there words with spaces or without spaces uh conjunction words as well as
hyphens and apostrophes a lot of these are going to fall out of what you're
able to bid on also in the paid search side and it will all go into a
particular group of words under a primary heading so that's where voice
search is taking us is really a condensing of the language into intent
what are people searching for and how do we give that their in how do we give their information back to them now
obviously this isn't perfect I've worked with a number of clients where
they may offer a service and because of that service Google is trying to then
associate them with another service uh and it's not relevant and so because of
that machine learning sometimes uh what we're seeing is a difficulty in trying
to get unique businesses new ideas or something that just isn't a part of that
overall big picture uh they're trying to force it into neat little boxes but as we know business is not full of neat
little boxes uh it's messy it's fuzzy it's it's all kinds of different types
of businesses suppliers industries that are going to have some level of
uniqueness about them so hopefully this can continue to improve uh but it does
at this point still need some human intervention the second aspect is voice search and
maybe some of you have uh maybe the Google home or the Alexa Appliance in
your home and you've been playing around with it and seeing what it can do uh but
also everyone's phone uh and then also Cortana is on uh any Microsoft operating
system desktop and so being able to search from your phone simply by a voice
command uh now this is affecting our ability to report because this does not
show up uh as a search now if you're using Google now and you are searching
on Google or a Google app it will show up as a search referral however if
you're using Cortana if you're using uh Siri it's going to use the
search engine of the operating system and so in that case and I'm going to address this a little bit later it shows
up as a direct visit rather than uh a search initiated visit and so this is
affecting the reporting of SEO metrics uh but at the same time it is also
changing the search landscape entirely right now uh Amazon is probably Google's
biggest competitor for most searches especially for electronics uh especially
for uh what you would consider things for Home and Garden Amazon and right now
has taken about 40 percent of the market share away from Google in terms of
electronics and Home Products because people are going to Amazon first and
they're using Alexa to do this so how voice search it really is going to be uh
a volatile industry to follow over the next five years
and then as I mentioned before probably the biggest frustration of anyone doing search engine optimization or wanting to
measure the effectiveness of optimization or where they stand in the marketplace is the keyword not provided
now there's a number of reasons why Google has gone about this the first reason that they gave was for privacy
reasons that they wanted people's searches to be private but at the same time if you are doing paid search you
have full access to keywords and also if you are advertising through Google you
can Target People based on their Search terms so we know the Privacy thing uh was really kind of a smoke screen I
think what's going on here is that this was really the first step to getting
people away from thinking of individual keywords or key phrases and focusing on
one or two phrases that there that would describe their business by taking away
the vast majority of keywords that you're going to see in your analytics it will force you to look at other words it
will force you to think bigger picture rather than those one or two words that
most people believe that's what my business needs this is where I'm going to focus my attention and in in so in
some ways this has been good by making people forcing people to think Beyond a
single word or a single phrase about their business and looking into the bigger picture this also plays into the
machine learning because as I showed you before machine learning is condensing all of these keyword phrases trying to
determine intent and what better way to really assist that than to start taking
away keyword data in the search engines however when you take that away you have
then taken away the number one reporting fact after uh of SEO and that is what
keywords am I ranking for what keywords are bringing in not only visitors but business and so by taking away the
number one factor we're forced to look at a number of different methods that we can use then to develop better campaign
metrics now one of the first things about uh metrics is the expectations whenever I
work with a company I want to know specifically what are your expectations for the campaign what are you trying to
get out of it what do you expect uh I'll never forget I was Consulting with an
agency about how they are developing their SEO campaigns and how they were
reporting them to their clients uh and I went with them oops to one of their
client meetings and after some of the agency people left
um I asked if I could talk with a client for a bit after the meeting and because the main reason was on this white board
in the corner of their office uh they had visits this month and visits last month
and the client asked me about the agency
um you know what I was doing for them and what they what the agency was trying to do and then they said that they had
concerns and the reason why they had concerns is that the visits last month
uh were higher than the visits this month and that over the past few months
the number of visits had been going down and because of that they were having a
lack of confidence in their agency now this was really kind of surprising
because this goes right to the heart of client expectations
uh no when I had asked that client then after that you know towards the end of
the conversation is how how is your business how are leads how are your key
performance indicators how are the conversions on the site
basically asking them how's business uh and the response to that was well
business is great business has been improving over the past few months however the primary metrics they were
looking at was visits rather than the business oriented metrics and so this is
where establishing expectations of what campaign metrics we're going to follow
and what those campaign metrics mean to a business this is a conversation that
must take place rather than just reporting basic information the same
charts and graphs every month or every quarter that really might not communicate the information that
everyone needs and so a conversation between agencies and clients about what
are the expectations of this SEO campaign what do we want out of that and what constitutes success that
conversation needs to take place and then that will determine how the
campaign metrics are then developed and presented and the discussion that will
happen around them now one thing that I think has been uh
you know I would say both a struggle as well as what needs to happen the the first thing about SEO metrics is the
myth of the number one ranking once in a while I'll still run into this where
someone will hinge the entire success of a campaign
by seeing the number one ranking they want a single word or a tooth word
phrase to rank number one in Google and that is their only standard of success
unfortunately I you know anymore I will not even work with that kind of a client
because it's an unrealistic expectation and it also shows a complete ignorance of how search works and what it the
power of what it can bring to your business that this is much bigger than a number one ranking and if that's all you
want then give me a budget we'll pay for it uh but I would say for the most part
we've moved Beyond a number one ranking uh and now what we have to educate
people on is that rankings are really a personal metric that you the rankings
you see are probably going to be slightly different than every body else
and I'm going to walk through why that happens and so you can help educate
people within your own organization of why ranking is a personal metric now rather than a universal metric
and then of course as I had mentioned before it's on the expectations
campaign metrics need to focus on the business objectives not just on the
external factors of rankings and and somewhat invisibility uh we want to look
at the visibility of a company but ultimately what we need to look at is how is your search campaign
delivering on your business objectives because that's the point of it all is
what are we what are we trying to accomplish and how is it being accomplished
see it's when I see charts like this that still make me a little queasy and
still make me roll my eyes this was done uh about two years ago asking people what are you measuring and unfortunately
there hasn't been much change since this initial survey that the vast majority of
people are measuring the number of visits to the website uh and then they're measuring social
sharing time on site and less than half are still measuring SEO rankings
um now that still boggles my mind because that's what I'm going to walk through here is why we can't measure SEO
rankings it is a completely undependable metric and so
what what really surprises me shocks me is that 35 percent of people are
measuring subscriber growth and 27 a little more than a fourth of businesses
surveyed here are measuring sales leads this is what is so shocking and
surprising especially when we come to campaign metrics and expectations of a
client and that is what are the business objectives what is it that you want to
grow because the last column here sales leads is what makes business grow that
is a direct contributor to revenue and subscriber growth well that builds
my list and marketing to my list is a direct contributor to revenue
and so as I said this is just so mind-boggling because the two things
that directly contribute that have a direct impact on Revenue are the least
measured in this survey the four things that have an indirect impact uh meaning
that you can have is as I mentioned before an incredible number of website visits but absolutely no Revenue coming
in as a result of that these are all key performance indicators
visits sharing time on site those are key performance indicators they're not
business objectives and so part of the expectations of developing campaign
metrics is understanding the difference between a key performance indicator and
a business objective because it's easy to get sidetracked especially with
search metrics especially with these types of things of you know visits time
on site uh page views rankings but they're all indirect which is why they
are under the key performance indicator uh grouping whereas we want to look at
the business objectives of subscribers sales leads downloads getting
information into people's hands engaging with them and moving along the customer
Journey when we can develop metrics that Focus on the experience of a prospect or
a customer then tie that to our SEO performance now
we're developing how our Campaign Will directly impact the business and the
customer now I want to just go off to the side for a little bit here and talk about
rankings and this is the whole concept of rankings are personal not Universal
now you'll notice on this this is the this is a a rankings report from 2008
and compared to 2006. I had to go back really far to find this screenshot and
this is of uh if you were doing a search for the keyword latest news this would
show you who ranked number one uh and the change in the rankings over the past
two years and it also we're looking at it in Google and MSN for some of you
this may look really familiar because what this did is you put in the domains
that you were tracking the keywords and you would get a report about who ranks
where for what keyword now this is back in the day and even around 2008 uh we
were still seeing some or we were starting to see fluctuations in rankings based on where you are searching from as
well as some history coming in but we weren't seeing it to the extent that we
see it today you see now today your rankings that you
see are largely based on your search history it's based on past searches it's based
on content preferences uh what types of content you tend to search on click on or visit uh what business or industry
you tend to uh search on as well as any
behaviors such as your uh predilection to click on ads paid ads display ads or
anything like that and so what's happening here is this has been actually going on for the past 10 years is that
more and more of your rankings are going to be personalized to your unique
history and the words the sites that you visit the words you use uh the types of
queries that you make all of this is being developed in order to provide you
the most relevant personal results ultimately it's also being done in order
to focus the paid search ads specifically to you and your behavior
and the industry that you're in because that's how the search engines monetize
so the better they understand you and what you're looking for and again it all comes down to intent if they can figure
out your intent and provide you results that are relevant both paid and organic
then that's the goal that's what they're trying to do and so simply based on your
history we're seeing that rankings are going to vary from person to person and
maybe even from computer to computer to smartphone depending upon how you use
them the second thing is Regional results uh
if you search for specific things in one region it's going to show up differently in
other regions if I search for right now if I go to Google and type in for dealership I'm going to see the one
that's near me and I'm not going to see one that's out in another state or
another region because based on the localization that search engines are
providing it's going to look at that query as a localized result and serve it
to me specifically So based on location now sometimes we will see things brands
are more Global however if I'm looking for something that is specific to my region that can be based on my IP
address my country my city my state even into a zip code uh local results
targeted results can be limited to a small area to only show to people who
are within that area or searching in that area and so more and more based on
localization we're seeing that affect the results and that has been highly
impactful especially over the past two to three years as local search has just gotten miles better uh in all of the
search engines and it's only going to increase as well uh but then also based on the different
types of media based on language based on the type of search uh the intent of
search or what words you might use as well as here we have the machine learning come in what you'll notice here
is simply if I do a search for something in Spanish as compared to English I get different results I get a completely
different results page uh there's more videos on the Spanish results uh from
the Spanish search then the English uh also the makeup of the page is
completely different so the words you use how you structure the query the
language those are all going to affect the type of results that you see and then also as you can see here is that
the organic results you know we're seeing videos uh taking over results how
to's uh actual uh you know multiple things happening in the search engine
and results page and so it's no longer just a list of 10 links and running a
ranking report to see where you rank because What's Happening Here is we're seeing multiple videos being served
prior to even seeing any what you would call a traditional link or traditional
website snippet here showing up in the search engine results page so as you can
see all of these things are just completely transforming a individual's rankings and so if you
were to measure rankings what you're measuring is unreality uh you're you're
measuring something that doesn't exist uh and as I like to say it's a it's
extinct before it's even run because no person will ever see a ranking report
they will see that reflected in their results it's going to be personalized
and unique something also to throw into the mix that even based on your device
you are going to see different results primary reason is because if you're
using a smartphone it knows your location and so you're going to have location results mixed in also based on
contracts with different search providers uh with different uh
you know licensing from Google licensing from YouTube uh the results will be
different based on the phone you use based on the provider that you have uh
and based on uh simply just being mobile as opposed to desktop so results are different based on the
device so hopefully if anyone uh was hoping to run a simple ranking report as
an SEO campaign metric uh just this little side light here has shown it's
really a non-starter anymore the traditional ranking report is extinct
and we have to move beyond that so how do we move beyond that because there's
also now that I just shared the the difficulties of a traditional ranking report we also have a couple other
obstacles thrown at us that are specifically uh both from a search
engine standpoint and from a user standpoint the first obstacle that we're running
into is from a search engine standpoint this is what Google is doing if I do a
search for top car reviews in 2017 at the very top of the results
I get a snippet of information uh pulled from Consumer Reports now
what's happening here and you may have seen this as well if you type a question or something like that that Google is
not only displaying websites but they're displaying the answers and they're
pulling the content from these websites now when they do that that does not show
up as a visit and it doesn't show up as a ranking to Consumer Reports Consumer
Reports has no method of tracking this
visibility and it's incredible visibility so at one point Google is
providing information to the searcher but the owner of this result is having
its content displayed by Google without any knowledge that it's happening unless someone has gotten in in order to see
that so this is a significant amount of visibility that right now goes
unreported because there's no way to integrate this into any metric
calculation uh other than a visual inspection to see what's happening with
this we're going to see more and more of this Google is presenting more and more
answers through the search engine results page rather than just the website
the main reason is Google has seen the more they do this the more they deliver
the answer in the search engine results page rather than having people click
through to go to a website they find that people are more likely to come back and use Google again
and what's happening here is that Google essentially is eliminating The Click
through they're trying to keep people on the search engine results page as long as
possible think about some of the searches you've done recently if you search for weather information you
search for flight information if you search for sports scores on Google uh those types of things you're going to
get your answer in the search results page you don't even have to click anywhere else to get the information
it's right there this is going to not only grow under
Google but this is really the big question mark as to what is the whole
purpose of Google and what are they doing and how does it benefit me as a website being in these results when I
can't track this and when Google is trying to keep people on their site on
their property as long as possible this is the big question mark moving forward for SEO metrics
the other side of this is from a consumer standpoint and this is what we call dark search dark search are
searches that originate from a non-traditional search engine for
example if you do a search from your computer for example Cortana or if you
do a search from your operating system in uh in apple you can do a search uh
almost on the uh the desktop through the spotlight search and it will bring up search results
if you go through that uh it's using basically the search engine capability
built into the operating system but it doesn't get reported as a search engine referral instead what's happening is
it's sending you to that site as a direct traffic so anything that's from an operating system a search that comes
through an app now if you're using the Google app this is kind of a a kind of a
gray area um but it does happen so you basically
have to install the Google Search app or use something in the browser but if
you're in an app with a search function and that app is not a search engine app
it will show up as direct traffic uh your voice based searches that's using
the operating system uh now you can use a voice based search in the Google
Search app and that will show up as a search referral I know this might get a
little confusing uh but this also is you know this is sort of the dark search of
what's going on uh and then also Amazon like I said is stealing a lot of
business away from Google uh but there's no way to really know what your Amazon ranking is for a
specific product or query uh so in that way you're kind of losing some of
whatever Amazon is taking we're also losing some of that data so those are some of the obstacles that
we're running into in terms of getting a big picture of campaign metrics
so like I said we need to start with a business goal when we start developing campaign
metrics this is where the expectations need to be very very clear uh and I kind
of like the acronym of clear here that we need to clearly State what is the business purpose what are we trying to
ultimately accomplish and how will search help to accomplish that
based on that we create a set of goals we lay out the goals of a campaign what
do we want people to do and then carry that over into how does that accomplish
the purpose we then explain how and define success
explain how success is accomplished as people meet those goals how does that
fit into the customer Journey where is that in the customer Journey how does it move them from one stage to the next how
do we measure that and how do we Define that as success then we align metrics to
that strategy we don't just start with the metrics we start with the purpose
the goal defining success and then aligning metrics as we have our strategy
and then the final stage is the ideal customer experience how do we relate that through these metrics how do we
explain that our customer has seen this and then they did this or they looked
for this information and it was a successful visit now what will they need this is where we look at the overall
customer journey and how search is a part of that Journey
now getting into some very specific metrics that will assist this one of the
things that I like to look at and this can be a part of the reporting if I'm
looking at just the cold hard facts of of SEO campaign metrics one of the first
things I'm going to look at is that audience overview and I'm going to look specifically at my organic traffic now
one of the things I need to caution is making sure and I'm I'm surprised I
still have to say this is comparing like time frames you can compare year over
year if you're comparing the entire year quarter to quarter example is I'm
looking at first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016. I want to compare
like time frames I am amazed at how many businesses still look at month to month
to month to month and there is such a drastic difference between month to month you have to compare this quarter
to the same quarter last year this month this year to let that you have to compare the like time frames going month
to month is is a is chasing your tail so from here I want to specifically just
look at my organic coverage at this point what I'm looking at here is with
the audience overview I'm looking at my total number of sessions this year compared to last year and I can see that
it's higher uh and in some areas I've seen some dips uh but then when I went
to go look at specifically in Google this year or this first quarter compared to first quarter last year where am I at
in terms of sessions new users bounce rate conversion rate and transactions
that's what's going to help me as far as getting the first step in my SEO metrics
the next is looking at total organic visits this is anything that comes
through search now again this is part of the conversation this is everything we can track uh because there are things
that are completely outside of this uh this might be a good time to say this I
was talking to an analytics provider a couple of years ago and in comparing
different analytics systems and I asked them what makes your analytics more
accurate than your competitors it was very interesting because this is the
lead engineer and he sort of shushed me this was on the trade show floor and he says in analytics we don't talk about
accuracy he says what I like to say is that our
analytics are less inaccurate than our class than our competitors
and that is really the case when it comes to analytics if you've ever
compared analytics from two different systems and looking at the same metrics
they never agree I'm always amazed at how many people try to make their Google analytics line up
with their omniture analytics and it will never happen or they'll look at multiple different packages or they'll
tell me my agency is reporting these numbers but these numbers are what I'm seeing and they're using two different systems that's because
Analytics it's tracking what it can track and what is unclear an algorithm
tries to organize it or an algorithm tries to assign things that are unclear to
different areas so each analytics program kind of has its own methodology
of organizing the information and interpreting it based on that that's
where you come up with the we're less inaccurate than our competitors so when we're measuring organic coverage we're
measuring what we can based on this system it may not agree with another
system don't try to make it agree because it just simply won't now here I'm looking at my total organic
search visits and I can see compared to the the year prior this quarter is up 18
in visits I can look at total conversions and I can see that it's up
30 percent uh and then also what I want to do is look at landing pages and my
keyword Concepts now this is a sense because the search engines don't provide
us any keyword data what we can do is look at our landing pages and the amount
of visits those landing pages are generating then it doesn't take much to kind of
look at those landing pages and see what what are they basically about what are those keyword Concepts now you can go to
uh Google search console you can go to Bing webmaster tools and you can see
which keywords uh are driving traffic to your business through those webmaster
portals and you can get the concept of what keywords uh are driving traffic now
one thing I do like about Bing webmaster tools is that Bing webmaster tools will not only show me which keywords I'm
ranking for and which ones are sending traffic to my website but they will also show me which Pages or the recipients of
those keywords so they are able to tie together the keywords and the landing pages and so I'll do that in bing uh on
also Google search console will do that to an extent but to some degree this is still a
manual process of looking at my landing pages and comparing them to the keyword
Concepts as I said Google's trying to push everything together into intent and
so evaluate your landing pages in terms of intent what would someone be searching on in order to get to this
page and utilize Google search console and Bing webmaster tools maybe some of
your analytics in order to figure that out also what I like to look at are
comparative metrics when I'm looking at the success of an SEO campaign as tied to other types of
campaigns I also want to show the value of search engine optimization and what
it's providing and so in looking at a source medium I'm using Google analytics
here what I can do here is for this time frame look at the overall numbers of
sessions generated through each Channel as you can see there Google on its own
is about 67 percent of all visits Yahoo is providing about
[Music] 1.28 percent of visits and then we can see a little less than 20 percent are
direct visits so comparatively I can see where my search engine optimization is
contributing in comparison to all the other channels and I can get a sense
there into terms of I can run a revenue report by Source where I can see where
my search is responsible for the greatest amount of revenue for the greatest amount of orders uh and also
when I look at uh when the interesting thing here I can also do a value per session breakdown and what this shows me
is uh the email campaigns those by far have the highest value per session
visitors coming through the blog are next in value per session and then we
can see our search visitors showing up there as a significantly high value per
session um and one thing you might uh jump out to you there is you can see that Bing has a
four pound 27 value per session compared to Google with a one pound 77 that's
normal I over the past 15 years it has been a really interesting phenomenon
that visitors from Bing or MSN have a higher value even though I will get uh
just sheer numbers and higher revenue from Google but they are higher value visitor uh than Google visitors uh
that's just a phenomenon that we've just observed for more than about 15 years and really kind of interesting there uh
so from a metric standpoint I like doing comparative metrics to see here's how
search compares to your other channels here's what it's driving compared to your other channels in terms of visitors
in terms of Engagement in terms of Revenue and revenue per user
uh and again I I kind of mentioned this associative metrics using Google search console uh to see some of the keywords
that Google is driving uh Google my business I'm going to show that uh as we get into here before we wrap up Bing
webmaster tools as I said they will show you the keywords as well as the associated landing pages analytics uh
getting into analytics and looking at your organic traffic I showed you a few reports there uh but that is where
people need to live in order to understand what's going on with their search traffic and more and more
um alongside analytics I'm seeing a CRM integration with analytics really
becoming a a different standard because within the CRM integration I can then
look at the entire customer journey I can track the initial touch point of a
consumer I can then see how that spreads into different searches so maybe they'll
find me first from a paid ad but then how does a subsequent organic searches
contribute to different touch points and then maybe there is a retargeting touch
Point uh and so I really like what I'm seeing with modern CRM systems and
tracking more of the customer journey and how search is a part of it and that
really then gets to the point of looking at that customer Journey that ideal
customer experience and it immediately puts it in the context of the purpose of
the campaign uh and the goals of the campaign focused around the user experience
when I'm talking with a client laying out expectations really my first question is what makes you money because
that's what we want to track there's our purpose we want to look at sales and leads and so I want to look at this
prioritized outcomes this gets back to what is the purpose of the overall campaign
then we need to look at what are performance goals now not all of these
goals carry the same amount of weight what I mean by that are inquiries support uh
people viewing videos online chat subscribes downloads those are all a
different level of Engagement than a typical like or retweet or a pin
um that's what I call you know it these are much more active if someone makes an inquiry that's a lead if they
contact support if they're viewing videos about new cars that's a
performance goal that means I'm engaging somebody and I'm answering their questions uh we can look at people
subscribing and asking for more information downloading brochures downloading information this is where
we'll attach different value to different actions because some actions will contribute much more in terms of
value in the customer experience than others and so we want to look at the performance goals and establish a level
SEO KPIs
of value around them and then explain clearly the difference
between a performance goal and a performance indicator performance indicators visibility visits
time on site Pages viewed bounce rate these are all good performance indicators but they are removed from a
direct impact on the business goals it's an indirect factor in fact they can even
be misleading if that's what you're using because you can see that business goals are excelling while these numbers
might go down or they might go up and business goals go down because it's what are you doing with the information and
how are you focusing your efforts I want to focus uh real quickly before I
wrap up here on uh Google my business and this is something that uh Google has
done more and more of I'm using actually a local landscaper that I've been helping out simply because I love the
numbers that are showing up on this um and it's really cool because you just
put your business in and then you set the service area so it can be a zip code it can be a radius uh and then you can
view the insights this is just on the left side is the login panel and it will
show you how many searches your business has shown up for in the past month as we
can see here we're over we're almost at about six and a half thousand searches
where people searched for uh their business we
we can see about 8.3 000 views of their local listing and
about uh 16 000 actions uh so we can see here this
now this probably right here is probably going to be I think the future of SEO
metrics the main reason is this is what happens when you do a search for a local
business and the business box shows up in the results and that business box as
a picture of the business a description hours uh pictures
and phone number and what can happen here just like with the information
where Google is showing all the information and you don't even have to click through it this is tracking that type of visibility
this is showing you how many times simply your business information showed
in the search results and so now from here we can look specifically on uh what
customers how they viewed your business and we can see how many times the business showed up in Search and how
many times it showed up on maps in the top graph in the lower graph and this is where I think this is I I think this
where reporting is really going to be moving is from that business box in the
search results we're now showing in the past month how many total actions people have taken and
that is how many people visited the website from the the inbox information box how many people requested directions
and how many people called from that business listing and the far right graph
shows you how many people uh the dark green so maybe a little over a fourth of
people were looking for the specific business name a little more than or a little less than
three quarters of people we're looking for related keywords and because of that
saw the business information so from a visibility metric standpoint
within Google search results I love what Google my business is doing because it's
providing me a view of how many people are seeing my listing without even
clicking on it but then because of the interactions available through smartphone searches local searches map
based searches I can track a lot of this local activity and how people are then
integrating uh or engaging with my local
search results on google.com uh so reporting has changed it will
continue to do so that is the only uh that is the only hard and fast rule here
uh and so metrics need to focus on uh emphasizing conversion rates optimizing
landing pages and it requires analytics expertise much more than ever and
ultimately what we want to get to is a measurement of the user experience like I said that big picture of the user
experience did they find what they wanted uh doing task-based user testing
where they have to find a specific bit of information uh from the search to the
site and from that you can gather an understanding of how quickly they're able to find it how they can navigate
there both in a desktop and a mobile and this gets to the the micro moment
assessment when people are searching for things such as can I afford it uh show
me the new cars where can I get Finance those types of
micro moment questions that people type into the search box or speak into their
phone okay I'm going to start out with how to set up a Google analytics account
Google Analytics - How to Setup Google Analytics Account
and so we're going to talk about everything that entails including creating your Google analytics account
we're going to talk about setting up a property in your account and what a property is we're going to talk about
setting up a reporting view in your property and we're going to talk about installing the tracking code so those
are the series of steps we're going to go through today in terms of setting up
a Google analytics account so let's get right to it and so really the Bruin prerequisite here when it comes to
setting up a Google analytics account is to have a Google login and ID so when
you actually go to Google analytics you need to be able to sign up or sign in
and so once you actually sign in then you're gonna go walk through a series of
steps but really that's really all you need to get the account going is a
Google ID and login so if you have a Gmail account or an other email account
that you use for other Google products then you're good to go that's all you need to do so when you actually go to
sign up for Google analytics you're going to be asked to set up a new account and these are the series of
steps you're going to walk through or go through to set up a new Google Analytics account so you're going to choose an
account name and then you're going to choose a property name okay so the account name can be anything you want it
to be the name your company your name whatever you want to name it the property name is really the website name
so what website are we talking about so here I'm going to set up a fictitious website name for now it's called demo
simply learn so the URL for this website demo simply learn is going to be
demo.simplylearn.com so that's the property when we talk about properties and analytics we're really talking about
what websites we want to measure and then you're going to be asked to choose an industry category and so for simply
learn we're in jobs and education but you have a number of different industries that you could choose from
it's as important go ahead and choose the most relevant industry that your
particular business is associated with okay and I'm going to talk about why that's important here in a minute and then you're going to choose your time
zone and the time zone is also important because that's when the day starts in
analytics and the day ends based on that time zone so the data that Google analytics collects starts and ends with
that time zone so very important to choose the time zone your business is located in okay and then you have some
additional options here okay so you have some settings and so the first setting is to allow Google products and services
so if you opt into this then basically what Google's going to do is share some
products and services with you via email I would go ahead and opt into that that's of course recommended by Google
it doesn't hurt to hear from Google on related products and services that may
enhance your business the second is benchmarking so benchmarking to me is
something you should opt into so going back to that industry and category we
chose jobs and education so by opting into benchmarking basically what
Google's going to do is share your data that it collects on your website in this
case demo.simplylearn.com it's going to share that data anonymously with others in the
industry in this case jobs and education and because you've opted in it's going
to do the same exact thing for you it's going to share Anonymous data on other
websites in the same industry and the benefit of that is we get to see what
other websites or how other websites are performing compared to ours what's the Benchmark in our industry and so the
benchmarking to me is important and I'm gonna go over that in a few minutes when we go over the different reports but to
me I would always opt into benchmarking because this is the only report Google provides in analytics about how others
in your industry is performing versus your website okay so it's a way to compare your website performance against
others in the same industry the other options here technical support and account specialist I would also
recommend you opt into those because then it allows you to basically Google
allow Google access to your account and they'll be able to help you if you occur
or run into any issues so these are the options in setting up a Google analytics account it's very simple very easy easy
to do you're just entering in a few Fields note that we talking about a
website right now so I'm talking about demo.simplylearn.com but just know that if you want to track a mobile app Google
analytics will allow you to do that as well you just choose the option mobile app so we're tracking a website we want
to know how users behave when they get to my website and that's what Google analytics is going to allow us to
measure and look at we just need to do a couple more steps in the process so once
we fill out these fields here we're going to click get tracking ID now I'm going to accept the terms of service I'm
going to accept another terms and service in relation to data protection
I'm going to click accept once I accept I'm going to be able to get some tracking code the tracking ID is the ID
associated with your account and so this number is going to be associated with
your account so your account I ID starts with UA and it's going to be this number
here now the dash one is the property you set up so in this case I set up
demo.simplylearn.com if I wanted to track multiple websites under that same
account then I can certainly set up multiple properties just know that every
property I set up in that account is going to have a dash 1-2-3-4
Etc depending on how many properties I set up so by default I set up one property so my first property ID is dash
one if I set up a second property the same account number it's just gonna have a dash two and that's important because
that ID that account and property ID is going to be associated with that
particular property or website so again once you finish setting up the account settings then you're going to be asked
to add some tracking code to your site and that tracking code is going to be related to the account and the property
so notice my tracking ID up here notice the tracking ID and the snippet of code
now this snip and a code needs to go on every page of your website that you want
to track and you don't have to put it on every page but if you want to track website behavior on every page or
website then it needs to go on every page of your website so if you're using a you know platform like Drupal or
Joomla or even more popular platform like WordPress adding the tracking code
site-wide is as easy as maybe adding a Google analytics plugin to Wordpress for
example and then just simply plug in in the ID now there's an alternative to adding the Google analytics tracking
code to your site and that's Google tag manager so Google tag manager is the way
I would recommend going so if you're not familiar with Google tag manager I would recomme man watching the YouTube video
we have on Google tag manager you can just go to YouTube Type in simply learn Google tag manager and this will give
you a nice overview of you know what Google tag manager is and how it works
but basically this is the way I would go and I would recommend that in addition
having Google analytics you set up a Google tag manager account and then that way you can put the tracking code in
Google tag manager so if I go to Google tag manager and I just go into an account on tag manager I can just simply
put in the Google analytics ID right into tag manager and so if I have it in
tag manager then tag manager is going to be the place that holds the code and
fires page view when somebody comes to my website so that way I don't have to add the tracking code to my website if I
do it in tag manager so that's the recommended method for me is to add the
Google analytics ID associate it with tag manager if you can associate it with tag manager then that's the easier route
to go versus putting code on your website okay so again take a look at the video we have on YouTube for Google tag
manager that's the route I would go now once you do get the tracking code on
your website whether that be through Google tag manager or through a plug-in or you know just simply adding the
script to your site to pages on your site then what's going to happen is you're going to start collecting data so
that's ideally the way it works you need to add this code to your website now if
you're not ready to do that and you simply want to basically understand how
Google analytics works then I would recommend getting access to Google analytics demo account and so if you
just type in and search Google analytics demo account basically okay what you're
going to do you're going to choose the first listing there and you're going to go to demo account so if you have a
Google analytics or Google login then all you need to do is click on access demo account and so what Google is going
to do is put this demo account into your account and so it's going to look something like this so if I click on
demo account here it's going to add to my Google analytics account so I'm going
to have then access to the demo account from Google in Google analytics so I
would recommend going this route here if you're not familiar you're not sure what
you're getting yourself into so think of the demo account as kind of a test drive you're test driving Google analytics
before you even add any code to your website so again all you need is a Google account and if you have a Google
account and you add the demo account to your Google analytics account you're going to be able to see how analytics
works okay and so that's what I I would also recommend so if you're not ready to start adding code to your website then
what you can do is just simply add the demo account and then once you add the demo account you're free to peruse
around Google analytics to see the different types reports it has to offer now when you do actually set up a Google
analytics account you're going to have some settings that you're going to want to pay attention to so when you set up
the account you have the account name and then you have a property so under each property you have by default you're
going to have one View and so here you can see this view here so if we look at the account we set up we set up a demo
simply learn account property is demo simply learn so that's associated with
the website we're going to track and then again by default under each property you're going to have a view and
so by default the name of the view is going to be called all website data and so in that view is where all your
Analytics data is going to be stored so you can see my screen here there's a lot
of different settings you have you have settings under the account you have settings under the property and you have
settings under the view so we're going to talk more about these settings and future webinars for advanced Google
analytics users but for now know that there's a bunch of settings that you have that you can play around with when
it comes to Google analytics anything from adding users to your Google analytics account your Google analytics
property or view you can actually set up goals you can set up filters you can set
up segments you can link up Google ads you can you know set up remarketing list
there's a lot you can do in terms of the settings as it relates to Google analytics but so know those settings are
there they're located right down here and this little sprocket icon that's the
admin icon so if you need to get to these settings at any time time you could simply just click on the sprocket
Google Analytics - Reports
or the admin icon and then you'll be prompted to choose any one of these
settings here that you want to edit or alter so now let's take a look at some Google analytics reports so once you've
actually set up your account you have a number of different reports that you have available to you in Google
analytics so we're going to take a look at you know customized reports we're going to look at real time audience
reports acquisition behavior and conversion so these are all the
different reporting buckets if you will that you have available to you in Google
analytics so if I'm in admin and I'm looking at the Google demo account let's
start out by looking at real time so if I click on the real time report and I
just click on overview so basically what this is going to do is show me at this
point in time how many users I actually have active on the website site okay so
that's why they call it real time reporting because it allows you to see the behavior of users who are currently
on your website and so this is the overview report under real time and you
can see here I can see that 79 percent of my users are coming from desktop 18
20 are coming from mobile and then approximately three percent are coming from tablet here I can see how they
actually came to the website so this is the referring Source if they came from
say search or social I can see the source there and I can see what pages
they're active on and then here I could see what locations where they're located and so if I want to see a breakdown of
everything in the overview I can certainly do that if I go to locations under real time I could see a majority
of my users are coming from the United States okay where are they coming from I'll just click on traffic sources and
here I could see the different source sources and mediums medium is the means
in which the traffic was driven so if it's Google it's either paid search or organic search so I can see here it's
organic then I can actually see what contents they're looking at on my website so I could see currently I have
three active users on the home page two active users on the Google's women's
white t page so forth and so on now most importantly if you have a vent tracking
set up so if you're taking a look at our Google tag manager webinar you know that
you could set up event tracking in Google analytics to measure engagement on your website whether that be a form
submission or somebody clicking on the play button of a video so if I click on events I'll be able to see what events
are firing so here I can see we have event tracking set up and I can see how
many different events are firing on my website in real time so here I can see econ Commerce somebody clicking on the
quick view click some a couple of users clicking on add to cart a couple of users clicking on the promotion click
and as these events are fired you're going to be able to see them highlighted so if something gets fired it's going to
get highlighted and I could see that these are the current events that I have
currently firing on the website and that's what's currently fire now if I want to look at the events that have
happened in the last 30 minutes I could just click on this link here last 30 minutes and it's going to give me an
overview of the events that have happened over the past 30 minutes okay so that's event tracking and then more
importantly we can also look at what conversions are happening in real time just by clicking on conversions and so
now I can see I had one active user who entered the checkout so that's goal
number four so in analytics you can have up to 20 goals and so here I can see we
have goal number four has already had one active user and so if I look at the last 30 minutes I can see I still have
only one goal over the last 30 minutes and that was somebody who entered the checkout so that's real time reporting
in summary it just gives you an idea of what's currently happening on your
website and so for me ideally if I'm launching a campaign or let's just say you do a new website redesign and you
want to see how users performing and behaving then real time is a good option for you so you could see how things are
happening in real time now let's jump down to audience reporting so if I click on audience this is just right
underneath real time I'm gonna see a number of different reports available to
me under audience and so let's click on the audience overview report so audience
reporting basically allows us to get a sense of who is coming to our website
when I say who is coming to our web website it doesn't necessarily have to be a specific person in fact Google
doesn't allow personally identifiable information in Google analytics personal
identifiable information such as a specific name uh social security number
credit card information Etc however we could still paint a nice
picture on who is coming to our website meaning what country city or state did
they come from what language what device do they get to our website from how old
were they okay were they male or female or other what interest do they have what
browser do they use so we can paint a nice picture based on all this information that Google analytics is
providing us under audience so if I go to audience overview here I can see I
have all these different options available to me to get a basic understanding of who is coming to our
website so for example I could see a majority of the people coming to our
website speak English and are from the United States okay in fact that represents 61 of the users and so Google
analytics does a great job of giving me an overall percentage so if I have a
hundred percent of the users I could see 61 percent of those users represented English-speaking users from the United
States seven percent represented English-speaking users from Great Britain and so when it comes to
analytics we have users and users are broken down into two categories they're
either returning or they're new so when you add the Google analytics tracking
script to your website what's gonna happen is if a user or when a user goes to your website they're gonna get
cookied if it's the first time they've been to your website what Google analytics is going to do is store a
cookie in the browser so when that same user comes back another day in the same
browser analytics is going to recognize that that cookie is in the browser and
so then analytics is going to categorize that user as a returning user okay so
that's how analytics is able to differentiate new versus returning so if that user doesn't have a cookie in the
browser then analytics is going to recognize that store the cookie and then count that user as a new user and so
when you're looking in analytics you're going to be able to see a breakdown of new versus returning so here I can see
over three quarters of my traffic over the past week here I can see April 6
through April 12th three over three quarters are new users to the website
here I could see about 23 24 are returning users okay so I can get a good
breakdown of what type of users are coming am I driving new traffic am I
driving traffic that's been to my website before what language are they speaking okay I can also paint a bigger
picture how old are they are they what gender are they do they come from mobile so let's take a look at some of these
different reports under audience and so if I skip down now to demographics I can
click on overview and when that report loads I can see now under demographics
overview I can see the breakout of age ranges and so here I can see the
majority of the traffic coming to my site again over the past week now if I want to change this date range I could
simply do that I can change the date range just by clicking on the date range and then maybe going say the last 30
days and I can even compare it to the previous period or the previous year I'm
going to choose the last 30 days I'm going to click apply now I'm looking at data over the last 30 days and again you
can change the date range to any range you want you can only go back as far as when you actually created the Google
analytics account you can't go prior to that so here I'm looking at the last 30
days and I can see almost 47 percent of my users were in their age range of 25
to 34. now when it comes to gender I can say 66 percent represent males so I can
get a breakout of gender and age as well as interest I can click on interest and
look at the overview there and see what the interest is of the users who are
coming to my site based on in-market segments or Affinity I can also choose
language and location so if I want to know exactly where my users are located
when they're coming to my website I can click on location and here I can get a breakout 43 of the users of the last 30
days were from the United States more importantly I can align my audience with
goals and we'll talk about goals here in a minute but he here I can see if I have an e-commerce website I can see of those
43 percent 0.29 of those converted or purchased something and that equates to
94 transactions so I can get a good sense of not only how many users are
coming from a specific country but are those users converting if I click on
mobile and mobile to me is one of those reports I tend to spend a bit of time on
because I want to know what devices users are coming to my website and so
for my website here or this is the Google demo website I can see mobile
represents approximately 27 of the traffic so desktop still represents a
majority of the traffic so for you you want to keep an eye on mobile because
mobile is definitely a majority of what people use nowadays that's how people
start their day that's how they transact Via mobile whether that's purchasing
something communicating or searching it all starts with mobile so you want to keep an eye on mobile and more
importantly you want to keep an eye on Behavior so Google analytics is telling me that yes I have approximately 27 of
my traffic of the last 30 days came from mobile how are they interacting with my
website so if I look across this report I'm going to be able to see different
metrics so if I'm measuring specific metrics against my dimension in this
case the dimension is what we're measuring and in this example we're measuring mobile I can see that the
bounce rate is approximately 48 percent and bounce rate means that if a user in
this case for mobile landed on a page they left the site without going any
further so they consider it a bounce if they don't go to another page if they
leave the site from the page they landed on and they don't go any further that's considered a bounce so bounce rate is
the percentage of people who come to the site and leave the site without going any further so in this case we have 48
bounce rate that's almost half of our users who come from mobile leave the website from the page they landed on so
is that good is that bad well it's open to interpretation is definitely
subjective but you want to keep the bounce rate as low as possible you want to keep people on your site especially
if you have an e-commerce website you want people who come to your website to
purchase and so here we can see 48 mobile and desktop it's a little bit
lower at 41 percent now if I look a little bit further at engagement I can
see how many pages on average do mobile users look at so versus desktop it's a
little bit lower you can see 3.86 on desktop it's 4.5 now if I look a little
bit further in engagement I want to be able to measure how long somebody from
mobile stays on the website if they're bouncing at 48 but they're also looking
at 3.8 Pages 3.9 almost four pages per session then that means in this report
analytics is telling me they're spending about two minutes on the site and interestingly enough I can see that
mobile of the last 30 days had more transactions so 51 transactions versus
34 transactions from desktop and interestingly enough the e-commerce
conversion rate is at 0.29 percent that's higher than desktop at .07 it's
lower than tablet but it's higher than desktop and mobile has the most transactions and since they have the
most transactions they have the most Revenue at 2 380. so yes the engagement
it isn't exactly as great as it is as desktop but we can see that people are
still purchasing with their mobile devices so it's something to keep an eye on and mobile is something I definitely
look at in fact since it's such an important report one thing you can do in
analytics is if you actually like a report and you think you're going to look at that report multiple times then
you can simply just go ahead and click save at the top here so if I click save
I'm going to enter a name for this report I'm just going to call it mobile report and click OK and then what's
going to happen is it's going to be located under save reports and save reports is located under customization
customization is located above real time okay so if I close that up you can see audience real time customization if I
click on customization if I click on Save reports I should be able to see my
save report here and I do so here I can see a mobile report if I click on it I
can simply go to the report I was looking at before I saved it so save reports to me is a good feature and
analytics because it allows you to quickly access a report that you've
saved in the past so let's take a look at one more report under audience and let's go to benchmarking so remember
when we were setting up our analytics account we had the option to opt into
benchmarking and I recommended you do so and so if you did I actually opt into
benchmarking then you're going to be able to see how your site compares to
others in the same industry so if I click on benchmarking and then click on channels what I'm actually able to do
now is compare my website with others in the same industry so if I go back to say
jobs in education and I choose education all education as my industry vertical I
should be able to see website sites that are in the same particular industry and
how I compare with those websites so I'm choosing all countries I can narrow that down if I wanted to I can just search
for the United States I can choose a specific State and then I can choose a
particular site size so here I'm choosing sites by daily session so these
are sites that have an average of 5 000 to almost 10 000 sessions a day and so
in this vertical education in the United States sites that have five thousand to
9999 sessions per day that means that they're approximately 310 web properties
contributing to this report okay based on this criteria I chose now if my site
is similar meaning if I'm in the United States if I'm in education and I'm receiving 5 000 to 9 999 sessions per
day then I'm able to compare my site against 310 other websites now Google's
sharing this data anonymously from the other websites and they're doing the same with your website to those
particular websites benchmarking reports okay so it's a shared data anonymously
in particular Industries and verticals and so now I'm looking at a channel
report so if I want to see how I compare to others in my industry then I can go
ahead and see by channel for example in my driving as much traffic as others in
my industry and you can see I'm not in fact I'm 76 77 percent worse in terms of
the amount of traffic being driven from organic search so anything in red is
going to show as a negative result a negative comparison whereas something in
green is a positive comparison so if I look at engagement I can see that I
might not be driving as much traffic but I can see that the pages per session are
better than the site average or the industry average I can see if I go over again looking just at organic search I
can see the bounce rate is better than the industry average so the channel report under benchmarking allows you to
measure how you compare to others in your industry and you could do so by looking at location and devices so if
you opted into benchmarking when you set up your account then you'll be able to
compare your website against others in your industry in your country region and
based on the size of your website in terms of how many visitors or sessions you're getting per day so let's go from
audience to acquisition so if audience is who is coming to your website acquisition allows us to see how the
traffic was driven to your website so how do these users get to our website and so under acquisition if we click on
overview we'll be able to to see an overview of how users whether they're
returning are new came to our website and so what analytics does by default is
they have a number of default channels and when we say channels we mean analytics is grouping different channels
based on how users got to your website meaning how did users get to our website did they come via organic search meaning
do they type something into Google and find you in the organic listing
analytics also groups users based on whether they came to your site directly meaning did they type in the URL
directly into the browser or did they bookmark your website and come back via
the bookmark so they're grouping users under direct they also group users under
referral meaning do they come from another website they group users by social do they come from a social media
platform like Twitter or Facebook if you're running paid search search meaning if you're running paid search on
say Google then do they come from Paid search ads now if you're running display ads on say Google's Network Google's
Display Network that's a default channel so analytics for group users there so if
they don't recognize a channel then they're going to group it as others so by default Google analytics groups users
and how they came to your website via these default channels and so I can see
how many users came to the site from each Channel now if I want to drill down
on this report I can click on all traffic and then if I click on all traffic I can go to channels I can look
specifically at the channels report and so now I can see organic search again
over the last 30 days is the number one channel driving traffic and they
represent approximately again you can see this number here in parentheses next to the raw number of users I can see
that number is about 56 cents so 56 percent of my traffic over the last 30
days came from organic search and so those are the number of users again as a
metric you're also going to have sessions and you'll see sessions a lot as a metric so users are broken down
between new and returning so every time a new or returning user comes to the
website basically what they're doing is initiating a session so you can have a
user who can come back multiple times every time they come back to the website it's a session so session is simply the
start of somebody coming to your website and the session ends when they leave the website and so just like we looked at
with the audience reports when it came to mobile we can also look at engagement
by channel so just like mobile we looked at bounce rate pages per session average
session duration we can do the same thing here with our our Channel report more importantly in addition to behavior
we can see conversions and since we're running an e-commerce platform we could see what the conversion rate is by
channel so organic search did drive the most traffic and they did have the most
transactions over the last 30 days and the conversion rate in this case is 0.17
okay so how Google determines the conversion rate they basically take the
number of transactions and divide that by sessions so that means that over the
last 30 days organic search drove 38 123 sessions and of those 38 000 123 64
actually turned into a transaction which equates to 0.17 which also equates to 3
000 in Revenue so I'm able to determine not only how users are getting to my
website by looking at the channel report I can actually see if they're in engaging and if they are converting and
notice when you look at a report in analytics you can look at it by Channel you'll also get a summary so here I can
see a summary or a total based on my date range so I could see over the last
30 days I've had 54 000 users 49 000 of them were new okay that meant
that out of this for 54 000 users I had 70 000 sessions I could see my average
bounce rate was 43 percent the pages per session were just over four and the
average session duration how long did somebody stay on my website on average about two minutes and 55 seconds the
average conversion rate was 0.14 and I had a total of 97 transactions totaling
fifty five hundred dollars okay and that's all over the last 30 days so any
report you look at in analytics is going to have a summary and note that any report you look at analytics is going to
allow you to save it so if it's a report you think you're going to go back and look at at a future date then you simply
just have to click on the save button conversely if you don't want to save it you can simply just export it so you can
export it as a PDF if I click on PDF it's going to allow me to export that as
a PDF now you have other options available to you as well you can do a Google sheet you can export it as an
Excel or you can export it as a comment delimited file so here you can see I can
save it as a PDF if I want to and if I click OK it's going to save to my
desktop or location of my choosing and then I can go back and look at it in that format at a later time so that's
the export feature available to you in analytics again if you you could save it
as well or you can export it okay some other reports under acquisition if you're running Google ads note that you
can to connect Google ads to analytics and this is key because now I can see
how many people are coming from Google ads to my website and are they
converting now this is important because with Google ads I'm actually paying for the click so you can see here I'm
running a report based on campaign data so I could see what campaigns are
driving traffic how much I'm paying per click and you can see on average I'm
paying 34 cents per click and then more importantly I want to be able to see if
they're converting so you can see I've spent 810 dollars over the last 30 days
and received 858 dollars in Revenue so you want to make sure that you link up
your Google ads account to your Google analytics account for this very reason
you want to be able to see how your Google ads campaigns perform once the
users get to your website and so I want to see if there engaging and I want to see if they're converting so they're all
sorts of reports under Google ads so you can look at it by keywords by search
queries by hour of the day if you're running display campaigns you can look at display targeting it says all sorts
of reports under Google ads you just have to link it up and you link it up under the admin now there are other
reports that you can look at so if I go to campaigns I can look at all campaigns
so if you're running all sorts of different types of campaigns whether that be on Facebook whether it be email
whether that be you know other types of advertising let's just say Twitter or
Instagram you're going to be able to see those campaigns here and that's under all campaigns and again you'll be able
to see the campaign name and you'll be able to see metrics associated with those campaigns and more importantly
you'll be able to see your e-commerce if you're running e-commerce platform or if you have goals set up so you'll be able
to look at how your campaigns are not one not only driving traffic but two are
they converting let's go from acquisition reporting to behavior so Behavior reports are going to actually
show you how users behaved once they got
to your website once they landed on a page on your website how did they behave so when we looked at audience we got a
sense of who is coming with acquisition we get a sense of how the traffic got to
our website did they come from organic direct social Etc the behavior reports
allow us to actually measure how that traffic behaved once they landed on a
page on our website and so if I go to overview under Behavior now I'm looking at this graph here it's showing me how
many pages I've had and a page view is simply once a page is viewed it's counted as a page view so if a user
comes to my site they're initiating a session and if they look at a page then that page is going to have a page view
okay so a user can look at a page multiple times in a session and every
time they look at that page it's going to count as a page view so here I can see in this graph how many pages I've
had again over the last 30 days and if I look further at my overview report I can
see the specific pages and how many pages they've had and I can also look at
some other metrics okay the average bounce rate the average time on page I
can look at the exit rate which means how many people actually exited or the
percentage of people who exited from that page so I can dig deeper into my
behavior reporting so if I click on site content and I click on all pages then
I'm going to look at a report by Page this is my Dimension this is what I'm measuring my page and now I can see how
many page views each page had of the last 30 days now note you also have
something called unique page views so unique page use is equivalent to one per
session in other words if a user came to my site and looked at the home page then
the home page is going to have one unique page view and one page view now if the user in that same session looks
at other Pages then every page that user looks at it's going to have one unique page view however if the user goes back
to another to the same page in the same session then it's still going to be one
unique page view but in this case the home page if they look at the home page a second time then the home page is
going to have two page views if they look at the home page five times in one session then the home page is gonna have
five total page views and one unique page view okay so that's why unique pages is equivalent to one per session
where pages is an accumulation of how many times the page was viewed in the
same session so in other words you're always going to have more page views than unique pages okay so this gives me
a sense of how my page is performed so again I can look at total page views and
then engagement so ideally what you want to do with a report like this is if a
user is not engaging on the page then that should tell you something about the page itself if they're not engaging if
the bounce rate's high if the time on page is low if the exit percentage of exit rate is high then you probably want
to do something with that page now these are all pages but if I jump down to
landing pages my landing page report is showing me how many people actually
landed on that page and so here I can see under my landing page report I can
see the home page had thirty six thousand 17 sessions in the last 30 days that's how many people landed on the
home page so here I can see 71 percent were news sessions meaning that I had a
lot of new users who landed on the home page in fact 25 000 or 52 percent of the people who
landed on the home page were new I could see the bounce rates about 42 percent but of those who didn't bounce they went
on to look at about 4.5 pages per session and spent about three minutes on
the site and the one thing I like about the landing page report is I can also
see whether that particular page in this case the home page did it help
contribute to a goal or conversion and in this case I can see of those 36 000
sessions I had 22 transactions totaling 1200 in revenue and that's an e-commerce
conversion rate of 0.06 percent so the home page over the last 30 days contributed to 0.06 percent of the
revenue so this gives you an idea of when somebody lands on your website and
they land on a page is that page helping to move that person along meaning are
they not bouncing and is that page helping to move people towards converting and so that's what the
landing page in effect allows us to measure is the engagement and in this case we're measuring transactions okay
so analytics also gives us some other reports under Behavior including site
speed so site speed to me is an important report to look at just like the mobile report to me site speed is
important because what Google analytics does is they take a sampling of pages
and in this case you can see over the last 30 days they sampled
2835 page views and of that sample they came back and said the average page load
time is about four seconds now ideally you want to keep it as quick as possible
I would say even under three seconds okay now there are other factors involved with page load time the browser
you're using the country that you're actually browsing that page from might know how to have the best infrastructure
you may not even be on the best internet Network meaning you're on a cell network
or the Wi-Fi is not that great or you can be on a page that just has a lot of images or a lot of code that may slow it
down so there are other factors involved and so what Google analytics does is show you what those factors are so here
I can see by browser with the average load time is if I want to look at Country I could see what country is
contributing to the load time now the great thing about the site speed report
is if I go to speed suggestions okay what speed suggestions is going to do is
it's going to show me the page load Time by Page and then it's actually going to
provide a link where I can actually click on to get suggestions on
increasing the page load time so for example I can look at this particular page here this Google redesign shop by
brand slash YouTube page line number five if I look at line number five I can see the average load time of this page
is eight seconds almost nine seconds okay that's an eternity to some people now notice this link next to it so
Google's recommending seven total suggestions so if I click on seven total what it's actually going to do it's
going to open up a new window and it's going to open up another Google report
called page speed insights and Page speed insights is going to give me some information about what I can do to
create correct correct the page load of that particular page so look at the site
speed report it's important because there is a correlation between site speed or page load time and user
behavior of that page and there's also correlation between page load time and a
page ranking organically on search so page load time is very important it's so
important that I'm even going to save it so I'm going to click save and click on speed site speed suggestions as my name
and click OK and now that report is going to be saved under customization under save reports let's jump from
Behavior to conversions now conversion reporting is arguably the most important
section in in Google analytics because what the conversions reporting allows us
to do is see how people are converting or if they're not converting on our
website and so in Google analytics we have the opportunity to set up goals now
you have the opportunity to set up 20 goals in your Google analytics View and
so to set up a goal okay so you're going to click on admin and Under The View you're going to see goals and so if you
don't even have goals the first step is to create goals and so you have four
different goal types in analytics so you have pages per session so how many pages
per session is so if your goal is set to say three or two if somebody actually looked at two or three pages per session
it's going to count as a goal okay so if I look here I could see I have pages per session set at 10. so that means that if
a user came to the site looked at more than 10 pages per session then it's going to count as a goal another goal
type is destination so destination means that if somebody actually went to a
specific page then it's going to count as a goal and in this case I can see
here that the goal is set to this particular page here and so when somebody actually lands on that page
it's going to count as a goal now there are two other goal ties we can look at one is duration so just like pages
question in our previous example is somebody looked at 10 pages per session it's going to count as a goal with
duration it's based on time so in this particular case if you set up a duration goal and the duration is set to say one
minute and 30 seconds then that means if a user comes to my website and they spend at least one minute and 30 seconds
then it's going to count as a goal okay and then the fourth type of goal in
Google analytics is an event based goal so when you set up event tracking you
could turn that event into a goal so if somebody clicks on say the submit button
of a form you can turn that event into a goal so here you can see the category
equals contact form so you can always verify if a goal works just by clicking
on verify this goal and in this case this event is turned into a goal so
anytime somebody fires this event it's gonna count as a goal so you have four
different goal types in Google analytics you have pages per session destination event and duration and so once you've
set up a goal then you can measure goals under conversions so now if I look at
goals overview I can be able to see how many total goal completions I've had so
if I want to look at it by goal I can just choose the goal option here so if I want to look at for example goal two
engaged users this was the pages per session I can see that I had a
conversion rate of 10 meaning that I had 7 000 of all the users that came to the
website 7 000 goal completions meaning 7106 users looked at 10 pages or more on
my website and so that's how you want to be able to measure whether users wherever they're coming from whoever
they are whatever Pages they look at you want to be able to look at the conversion in reports to see if they're
actually converting based on the goals you've set up whether that's pages per session duration destination or event
goal conversion tracking reports can help you measure who is actually converting and the great thing about
Google analytics here is that I can actually see by segments so the default
segment in a segment is just looking at a specific user set so the default
segment is always all users however I can choose a different segment so if I
want to choose instead of all users if I want to choose Mobile Traffic I can select Mobile Traffic hit apply so I'm
actually now looking at a subset of data I'm looking at mobile traffic so if all
the mobile users have come to my site I can see 1400 engaged or looked at 10
pages or more okay and that's a seven percent conversion rate so the great thing about Google analytics is you have
the opportunity to set up four different goal types okay based on those goal types you can go to goals overview and
look at the conversion rates of each goal but you can also change the
segments of that particular goal to see who exactly converted okay another
report I like under conversions is the multi-channel funnel report so if I click on multi-channel funnel basically
what this allows me to do is see how different channels work together to
convert so remember the channel reporting we looked at under acquisition here I can see now how different
channels work together to drive the conversion so if I look at three channels direct organic and referral I
can see all three together drive two percent of the conversions if I look at direct and referral twelve and a half
percent if I look at direct and organic 12.24 so I can see how different
channels work to together and so if I look at top conversion paths as an
example I can actually see what channels how channels work together to drive the
conversion so in this example I can see over the last 30 days that my top channel grouping was direct times two
meaning that somebody came to the website directly meaning they typed in the URL in the browser or they
bookmarked it and came to the site okay they came the first time but didn't convert but then they came back a second
time via direct and then converted so that combination is my top conversion
combination of the last 30 days my second best conversion grouping is
organic search and direct meaning that a user came to the website via organic
search first did not convert and then came back via direct the second time and
converted so basically what analytics does is give credit to the last refer
girl meaning if you came to the website via referral or referring website and
converted then the referring website's gonna get the credit for the conversion but analytics does a good job of showing
you how different channels work together so a channel may drive a lot of traffic
like organic search but that traffic may not convert the first time around for a
number of different reasons whether it could be brand recognition Price shopping reading content whatever the
case analytics is able to measure if that channel actually did contribute at
a later point and in this case we could see organic search drove traffic that didn't convert but that traffic came
back a second time via direct and did convert so that's our second best
Channel grouping and so the multi-channel funneling Report top conversion pass to me is a good report
to look at so you can actually see not only at channels work together but you can see sources and mediums and
campaigns and how all that all those different campaigns from different sources work together to convert so
that's just a good report to look at there are so many different reports available in analytics there's so many
that we haven't even gotten to yet so my advice if you look at the demo report you can get a feel for each of these
reports under each section whether that be audience acquisition Behavior or
conversions take a look at these reports see what makes sense to you see what you can use to improve your website
performance so if I go to Google analytics and I log in okay what I want
to do is go down to admin click on admin
here and admin will take you to basically a screen that looks like this where you have an account column you
have your property column and then you have review column now the view column is where you're going to go to set up
goals okay so every view in every property has up to 20 goals okay so by
default in analytics you're going to have at least one view for your property
so if I have a property I'm gonna have at least one view but if I happen to set up multiple views like you see here then
I know for every view I set up I have 20 goals to work with so where are those
goals so Under The View I'm going to click on goals and now I could see I
have 20 at my disposal now you can see here by clicking on the recording column
I can see I have in this particular property this particular view I have
five goals that are active so you can use up to 20 but you don't have to have 20 active Okay you can have one active
two active my recommendation is least have one goal again when you set up a
goal you're going to measure everything in analytics against that goal okay so
in this case we have five particular goals we're measuring so we have five active out of 20 total so if I don't
know no longer want to use a goal I could simply just turn it off if I want to continue using it just turn it on
okay it's that simple you could turn on and off goals so here I already have
five set up so if you want to set up a new goal the one thing you need to know
in Google analytics is in order to set up a new goal okay you need to have edit
access at least the view level I would say at the property level so you want to
make sure whoever's in charge of Google analytics for your organization or if
you're in charge okay you simply just want to go to user management and user management you want to make sure the
email address you're using to log into Google analytics has at least edit
permissions so you're going to need edit permissions to add new goals so I have
edit permissions I'm going to go to goals and I want to set up a new goal but before we jump in and set up a new
goal what is it that we want to achieve that's really the question we want to
ask ourselves what is the goal of the website well if it's somebody
downloading something okay are you measuring that download via an event okay are they filling out a form
submission before they download so if they submit that form submission is that the goal or do you have any Commerce
site is somebody purchasing something so these are things you want to ask yourself before you actually set up the
goal what is it that I'm trying to measure now when you actually do go to set up a goal you're going to click on
the red CTA button that says new goal so analytics actually has some templates
set up for you okay you can see them here okay if you're somebody's registering online or creating an
account or reading review downloading something sharing something you could
choose all of these options here what I normally do is choose custom 99 of the
time I'm just going to choose custom it doesn't really matter if you use the template or not it's just a template is
basically some free pre-filled configurations but my recommendation is
always just go with custom you want total control over how to set up your
goal so we already have in mind what type of goal we want to set up so for
example if somebody goes to fill out a form submission and they go to a thank
you page after that well what's the URL of that thank you page we want to be able to track how many people go to that
page because we know if somebody does type in or fill in a form submission and
goes to that page we know that they filled out the form and so for example if I go to continue I'm going to name my
goal first so I'm going to say thank you page as an example notice analytics is
assigning an ID so notice this is goal ID 15. that means that that's the next
available goal there are 20 goals available in analytics and so what analytics does is they group goals
together so one through five six through ten eleven through fifteen sixteen
through twenty into goal sets so for example goal 16 through 20 is part of
goal set for and why does Google analytics combine these goals into different goal sets well because it's
easier to measure and look at data by goal sets so for example if I jump into
any report here if I go to all traffic channels and I want to measure how many
goals by Channel I can look at it by goal set so if I have goal set one
selected then I know any goal I have active in there between goal ID one through goal id5 I'm going to be able to
see those goals and goal set one and now I'm going to be able to measure every goal I have active and goal set one
against the channel so if I choose goal set two whatever goals are active there goal set three Etc notice I don't have
any goals 16 through 20 active that earn goal set four therefore I don't have
that option available to me so back to admin the bottom left navigation again
goals okay we want to measure somebody going to the thank you page we have added access we're going to choose
custom as our goal setup we're going to type in a goal name I'm just going to say thank you okay this is goal 15. now
this is the important part Google analytics has four different goal types
destination duration pages per session or screens percent session screens per
session is related to mobile because Google analytics measures mobile app
activity and then you have an event so we're going to cover all four of these but for the sake of this simple example
I'm going to choose destination why because if somebody goes to that thank you page we're going to go ahead and put
in the thank you page as the goal the goal URL so for example destination is
my choice I'm going to click continue now this is where I'm gonna put the URL
so if my URL is just simply thank you.html I can just go ahead and put
thank you.html or if it's just thank you then I can just do thank you depends on
the website depends on the URI structure so whatever that URL is that's what
you're going to put in and when you're done you can verify it so what Google analytics does is actually we'll verify
over the last seven days is if anybody's actually gone to that particular page so
if we click verify we can see zero percent conversion rate so that tells us that if this is the correct URL then
we've had zero percent people go to that page this is just an example however if
you didn't see a conversion then you might want to make sure you check the URL here that you put in and if you do
see a conversion rate then you know it's working so Google analytics actually has options so we're saying thank you is
equal to so the destination URL is equal to thank you or thank you.html or thank
you dot ESP or whatever that thank you page is okay you do have options so if
you have a long URL you could say it begins with and you could say it begins with say thank you so this is the logic
we're going to say hey if anybody goes to a URL that begins with thank you then
count it as a goal or you could say equals to so if anybody goes to a URL that equals 2 thank you then count it as
a goal you have one more option Here regular expression so Google analytics understands the language of regular
Expressions so regular expressions are just special characters used to
communicate with Google analytics in order to hone in on exactly what you're
trying to track so we can always say you know starts with or ends with so we can
you know use characters like the dollar sign ends with or begins with so we can
always do that so you can use regular Expressions as well if you're familiar with regular Expressions if you're not
then you don't have to use them but there are special characters where that
you can insert in that are used as regular expression so if you're not familiar with regular expression don't
choose that option you can choose the other option of equals to or begins with now now note that on all three of these
options I didn't put the domain so if my domain is Amma Dash foundation.org and
then thank you I don't need to put the domain because analytics are already knows what domain we're tracking so you
don't have to put in the domain here when you're entering in in this case the
Google URL so you can omit the domain so when you put in that URL you know that
you have three options to work with and then you always always want to verify
that goal URL you always want to verify it because if you see zero percent conversion and in this case of the last
seven days then that should tell you something either your goal is not set up correctly or you just don't have any
conversions either way you want to double check that now when it comes to the destination URL goal you do have an
option here for funnel so if I turn on final then that means I have the ability
to track how people went through my funnel so if I have a cart and I want to
be able to check how many people go in and out of the cart then I have the option of adding specific Pages as part
of the cart so we could say you know step one which is basically cart we
could say step two is billing information that could be slash billing
we could see step three is shipping information slash shipping and then step four could be you know confirm and that
could be slash confirmation so whatever your url structure is for your cart and
it doesn't necessarily have to be a cart basically all I'm doing is putting a series of steps with URLs as each step
and why do I want to do that because I can then track how many people go through my funnel that I've created okay
so here I could see this is my funnel that I've created for this particular goal okay and the funnel is only
available for the destination URL so the funnels available if you want to see traffic through the goal okay and how
people go through the funnel and where they drop off now you have an option here to make the first step required so
if you make that first step required then that means you're measuring the funnel through the first step only now
if I turn that off then I'm measuring the funnel through each step meaning that I can measure people as they drop
in and out of the funnel where if it's required the first step then I'm only measuring traffic as it enters in the
top of the funnel so you have that option available to you the funnel and then for all goals you do have a value
so if somebody did actually convert Okay Google analytics is going to count it as
a conversion and you can assign sign a value so if you're not an e-commerce website then you may want to think about
assigning value if you are an e-commerce website then analytics has the ability
to track e-commerce revenue for your website so you don't need to add a value but in this case let's just say your
non-profit organization and you're collecting donations and on average over the past year every
donation that somebody contributed was equal to five dollars well you can just
go ahead and put five dollars in there as the value for that goal so that means
that if somebody did go to in this example slash thank you and convert
analytics is going to count it as a goal and then assign five dollar value
alongside that goal so if you're non-ecommerce if you're say a non-profit
like this organization or your B2B and you want to track some value then you
have that option there so with the destination URL goal you have the option of adding a funnel with all goal types
you have the option of adding a value all goal types and we're going to go through the rest of them you have the
option of verifying that goal so that's the structure of setting up a goal
destination URL is just one goal type we're going to talk about the other
three goal types because in Google analytics there are four goal types again destination is one of them with
destination as you do have the option with all goal types is you have to be
able to choose your logic here so we're going to cover that with the other three but just know when you set up a
destination URL goal you have the option of adding a funnel now when you actually do set up a funnel what's going to
happen is analytics is going to measure traffic as it goes to the final so where
do you look for that funnel information well you want to get out of admin you want to go to the left side navigation
you want to click on conversions then goals then funnel visualization So based
on the funnel you set up you're going to be able to see traffic as it goes through the funnel so notice on this
particular funnel we don't have the first step required why because I could
see traffic as it goes in and out of each step of the funnel so let's go through this funnel and see how people
react so here I can see the first step is the store front page so over this
particular period of time I have 84 sessions enter the storefront page so
out of those 84 I can see 21 left the storefront page 63 went on to the next
step in the funnel which is the cart page I can then see 24 people went on to
the cart page directly and five exited the site all together okay so that gave
me 87 total and from 87 I saw that 82 went on to the next page for the next
step what analytics does is they give you a percentage so in the first step we had 63 move on to the cart page out of
84 that's 75 percent so from the cart page to the create your account page we
had 94 move on so we didn't have anybody enter in the create your account page we
didn't have anybody leave to create your account page so if 82 82 create your
account and then we have 82 move on to the payment page so that's a hundred percent okay we have one exit so we have
81 that proceeded to beyond the payment page which was purchase so 81 of 82 is
98 and we started with 84. so that gave us
plus the 24 that we accumulated along the way so that gave us a 75 funnel
conversion rate so 75 percent of the people who entered in the funnel went on
to purchase okay so don't be confused with the overall e-commerce conversion
rate so 75 is the funnel conversion rate the overall conversion rate for this
particular goal is 18.45 over this particular period of
time why because that takes into account all sessions that have won to the website so 18 of all traffic went on to
convert but those that did go into the final 75 converted so that's a look at
the funnel so if you set up a funnel that's what it's going to look like you have the option to measure everything
from step one and Beyond or measure as traffic goes in and out of the funnel so
the purpose of this is we're going to be able to see where traffic drops off how
effective our funnel Liz what pages we need to address in that funnel okay so
that's the whole point of the funnel and the funnel is available with the destination URL goal so if I go back to
admin if I go back to goals Under The View I can actually see what that funnel
looks like so here we chose regular expression so this is what the URL is
okay you can see our funnel in each of the steps we have set up notice we're using regular Expressions here and then
if we verify this goal we could see over the past seven days 19 conversion rate
so that tells me something's working in this particular with this particular goal because we do have a conversion
rate okay so that's the destination URL goals let's now talk about the other
three types of goals so the next goal type we're going to talk about is pages
per session so if you're not sure what type of goal to set up for your web
website at the very least you should try and set up either duration or Let It Go
or pages per session related goal so let's talk about the pages per session
so basically what this goal is going to allow us to measure is for example if we
set the goal to three pages per session then we're going to be able to measure
if how many people went to the site and looked at three pages per session so
let's take a look at that goal so if I open up the goal here I can see three pages per session is what we're naming
it so basically what we're asking analytics to do is anything greater than
two pages which would be three and Beyond count as a goal so if anybody
comes to the site looks at more than two pages three pages or more then it's
going to count as a goal and so here we can verify it so if we verified over the
last seven days we could see a 4.12 conversion rate and that tells me that
four percent of my traffic over the last seven days looked at at least three
pages or more so you're probably asking yourself well what number should I put
in for the actual variable so in this case we see two well what you want to do
is you want to look at on average let's just say year to day you want to make
sure you have statistical significance so you want to look at a period of time so if you go to analytics go to audience
okay and then if you go to overview and if I change my date range to year to
date I could see on average right now I have 1.21 pages per session so that's on
average so we don't want to make our goal one page we don't want to make our goal two
pages we want to make it three so we want to be able to basically measure at
a higher rate okay why do we want to measure at a higher rate because if 1.21 is the average then two pages per
session really isn't moving the needle so what we really want to do is get people to stay on the site longer look
at Pages more during their session so look at more pages and so we want to be
able to see what segment of the audience is looking at more pages what channels
driving traffic that's looking at more pages what pages are contributing to more pages per session so the whole idea
is you want to hone in on what your goal is and see what's working and then see
what's not working so you can make adjustments the whole idea be on Google analytics is to improves website
performance and so if our average is 1.2 then if we change it to just 2 it may
not be good enough so in this case you know we want to up the bar a little bit so we're going to choose three now you
can choose four or five that's perfectly fine just know if your average is 1.2 I
wouldn't choose one page per session as my goal and I probably wouldn't choose two so I'd set the bar a little bit
higher now the third goal type available in Google analytics is also engagement
related and that's duration so just like pages per session we can measure how
long somebody stays on the website and we could set up a goal for that so in this case I have a goal set for one
minute 30 seconds so my goal type is duration so if I click continue then
basically I'm asking analytics in this case anybody who stays more than one
minute and 30 seconds on the website count it as a goal and so so before you
actually put in the number of hours minutes and seconds you want to look at that average so if you go back to
audience overview here I can see a minute and seven so do we want a minute
and 30 maybe we could do that maybe we can go with two minutes so again the whole point is you want to set the bar a
little bit higher than what the average is and so here I could see over the last seven days if I verify this particular
goal I can see eight percent of my traffic over the last seven days stayed
on the site at least one minute and 31 seconds okay they stay greater than one
minute and thirty and so the whole point is you can hone in because this is a goal I can go in this is goal okay this
is a goal here and so I could see that this is gold 13. so now I can go to
acquisition as an example I can go to channels as an example since this is I
go this is goal 13 so that would be in goal set three so I can actually see
what channel is basically driving that goal okay in other words what channel is
driving traffic that is staying on the side at least one minute 30 seconds and
so that's the whole idea behind goals so likewise for pages per session we can go
into channels and here I can see we have a over this period of time year to date
pages per session we have three percent conversion rate and here I could see for
example organic search has a 13 conversion rate here I could see social
media has a 10 so I could see that or people coming from organic search are
staying on the site longer or they're looking at more pages than any other channel so just like duration or
destination or any goal you set up you can measure that goal against any
Dimension just because his engagement doesn't mean you can't you absolutely
can and so the whole point of Engagement related goals is to figure out what's
driving traffic the site but what traffic is engaging so you want to be able to pinpoint that so you can improve
website performance now the fourth goal type available in Google analytics is an
event so if you click on new goal include custom click continue you have
the option to choose an event so an event is something that you can measure
on your website that analytics can't measure by default so if you want to measure PDF downloads or clicks on
buttons or clicks on play buttons on a video or click on a submit button or
click on an external link I mean you can measure pretty much anything with an event then you want to be able to turn
that event into a goal so let's quickly summarize what an event is so again we
want to be able to measure a particular event that happens on the website so in
order to do so we need to identify that event so if I go to for example this
particular website here and I want to measure how many times somebody clicks
on the Donate Now button well if I met I can measure that as an event so when you
set up an event in analytics you have to actually assign a category and an action
for that event so that's the first thing you need to do when you identify an
event or let it go first you need to set up the event in order to set up the event you need to assign a category in
action okay so once you identify what you want to track as an event on your website you're actually going to go on a
tag manager or have your web Master go on a tag manager and set up a tag and in
that tag they're going to assign that particular category in action and so
here you can see we have this set up our category is named donate now and our
action is click and that's what we want to do we want to measure how many people click on that donate Now button so
anytime somebody does that then the category donate now is going to appear
in analytics with the action click so when you actually do set up an event you
can go into analytics and you could test that event so if I go to the website and
I click donate now Okay the reason why I have this as an event is because I'm
taking to a third-party website to handle the donations so here I can go
into analytics and now I can see a category is being fired for header donate with the action click so that's
my category and that's my action so that category in action is what is firing
after somebody clicks on the Donate Now button so if I want to turn this event
into a goal I can easily do that now that I've set up the event now that I've
identified the category in action I want to go back to admin and set up the event
with these parameters in place so just turns out we already have the goal set
up so let's go through how this goal is set up so first we chose custom we chose
event we gave it a name so has the best practice when you actually set up a goal
as an event or turn an event into a goal I would add the prefix event colon to it
and then that way when you're identifying goals in your reporting you know it's an event so I'm going to click
continue and now that I've actually have set up the event already in Google tag
manager I giving it a category give it an action okay see here you can see we
have a regular expression set up so anything with the header donate or
donate is going to fire this goal so over the last seven days I have a 0.81
conversion rate okay I could have easily put in equals two and put in whatever
the action what or the category which is donate now or I could have put action
equals click I could have done that as well so let me show you another example here so if I do this custom continue
events donate now here's my goal ID it's going to be an event so all I need to do
is put in the category in action so donate now and then click so that's all
I have to do and that's my goal so I can verify it okay to see if anybody's fired
it and basically that's what I need to do to turn that event into to a goal
okay so you need to set up for an event first you need to identify the event set
it up and Google tag manager which is another platform and once you've done that then you have your category in
action once you have your category in action you're again going to go into analytics and then simply put in that
category in action into the appropriate fields to set up your event related goal
now all events don't have to be turned into a goal if you actually do set up an
event and you're not worthy of a goal meaning it's not a kpi or a dozen align
with your business goals well don't fret you can always just go to behavior okay
you can always go to events you can always go to overview and measure your
events that way so here you can see all of our events that are fired now we do
have this one turn into a goal so if it's important for a business then we want to make sure we we convert that
particular event into a goal okay if it's not important for example somebody's just clicking on a social
button then you don't necessarily have to turn that event into a goal if you
don't want to know that it's sitting here under events under Behavior so the
point I'm trying to make here if it's important to your business and you're already tracking it as an event via
Google tag manager then feel free to turn it into a goal all you need is a
category all you need is that action and so so one final note on that event
related goal just like any other goal you can add a value okay so if I have an
event set up I can choose to add a value here or in Google tag manager if I've
assigned a value to that event so if I go back to the actual event and Google
tag manager you can see I have a value set up for one dollar then I could just go into analytics and say you know what
I already have the value added so go ahead and use the value added in Google
tag manager okay so I'm going to choose yes now if I choose no I have the option
to add the value here just like I would with any other goal so just keep that in
mind you can add a value to any goal type with an event related go you can
add the value right into the tag in Google tag manager just as I've done
here so remember when you actually set up your goals whether it's a destination pages per session duration or an event
you can just go ahead and choose that goal set that it's in and measure any
Dimension against that particular goal so here I can see e newsletter sign ups
by Channel I can go into another goal set here I can see contact form
submissions okay I can see what particular channels driving contact form
submissions okay so just know that you can align a goal against any Dimension
so if you have e-commerce you don't have to set up for goal for that that's
separate but if you want to take a look at your goals and analytics and on its
own you can just go to conversions goals overview here I can actually get a good
sense of how my goals are performing over a period of time so again if I
choose for example year to date now I could see based on the goals I've set up
how many total goal completions value which takes into account the value we've
added into these goals okay the total conversion rate and here I can see it broken down by the goal I actually have
set up and I can see it by Page or I could see it by Source a medium so I
could see Google organic is driving the most gold completions then Google CPC
direct and then I could see some others in here as well out contributing to
goals now I do want to point your attention to another report in Google
analytics that does take into account goals and that's multi-channel funneling
so again under conversion goals multi-channel funnels if I go to
assistant conversions I can actually see what channel in this example is
assisting with the conversions I've set up and so what do we mean by assistive conversions well that means that if a
channel let's just say organic search drove traffic to the website and that traffic didn't convert when it arrived
at the website and left but it came back a week later via another Channel let's
just say email and when they came back via email they did convert during that session well what analytics does is they
give an assist to organic search because they help Drive the traffic to the
website so it's similar to the game of basketball if I have the ball and I pass
it to my colleague and my colleagues the one who scores because they had the ball last well they get the credit for the
point I.E the conversion but I get an assist and so analytics works the same
way they're always going to give credit to the last click or direct conversion
but they will give credits to the channel in this case that assisted with
the conversion so that's under a cystic inversion and that's based on the goals
you have set up you can highlight any particular goal here if I want to hone
in on say the Donate clicks only then I'm going to be able to see what
contributed to that particular goal so there's another report in here top
conversion pass that I think is important so after you set up your goals you can actually see what channels in
this particular example help to Drive conversions again this is year to day so
I can see all the different combinations of channels that work together to contribute to a conversion so again I
can choose a specific goal or I can choose all my goals so those two reports
are under multi-channel funneling there's also another report that I think is good that's time lag meaning how long
did it actually take somebody to convert so here you can see most of our
conversions 265 year-to-date happen on the day somebody arrived on the website
but I could see I did get some conversions a day later two days later Etc so you have time lag top conversion
pass assistant conversions they're all under multi-channel funneling and they're all available after you set up
at least one goal and so if you're not sure what goal to set up okay don't fret
you can always at least set up an engagement related goal so that's available to you duration pages per
session you also have destination and event tracking and they're all available to you you have 20 available per view
now if you're not quite sure exactly what type of goal to set up there is an
option available in analytics and that's the gallery so you can always import a
goal from the gallery so in other words we could take a look at what other
people have set up in terms of goals so you just have to click on the button import from gallery and it'll take you
to the gallery and you'll be able to see what are the goals others have set up so many of you out there have a website
similar to the one I'm looking at now this is a non-profit that I work with I'm a foundation and like this website
and probably like your website you probably have some interactivity on there that needs to be tracked for
example buttons if you have buttons like this one that says donate or newsletter
sign up or there's a PDF download or a video that needs to be you know tracked
based on the amount of people who click on the play button so I mean all sorts of inter activity on a website have you
ever wondered how to track that well there is a way to track that because by default Google analytics can't track
interactivity and engagement on your website like you probably want to have
your website tracked so if you have buttons and videos and things of that nature that you want to have tracked but
you're going to need event tracking and if you're in analytics and you're always wandering around the data and you happen
to find yourself under events well if you want events on your website and you
want data to populate under Behavior top events you're going to need to set up
event tracking so event tracking is a two-part process and we're going to talk
about that two-part process the first part of that is to identify what you
want to track okay so if we go back to our example website here I'm a foundation again we noted there's a lot
to track here we gotta donate now Bob we got a newsletter sign up we have some social icons okay we got a donate Now
button here we got a play button here got all sorts of interactivity you know we got a button here that says you know
purchase tickets for an upcoming event I can go throughout the website and find different buttons and things to to track
let me just say this there's no shortage of what you can track on your website with event tracking so event tracking is
just basically in layman's terms tracking engagement on your site because Google analytics by default is only
going to track page view data meaning how somebody got to your website what
page they looked at how long they stayed on that page what page they left from more or less their timing how long
somebody stays on the website and what pages they look at so there's more to a website than just how long somebody
stayed on a page and so in this example we want to be able to track everything
here not just the donating album but everything because once you get the hang of event tracking then it's very easy to
set up okay so step one identify what you want to track okay so there's a lot
we want to track we're just going to use one example to start off with and that's going to be this donate Now button okay
so this donate Now button we want to track now we have a newsletter sign up
we have Facebook and and that's fine you could track all that but for the sake of
going through a step-by-step process today let's just focus on the Donate Now button what's focus on the Donate Now
button then we'll come back and start tracking these other things but this is what we want to track to start out with okay so step one identify what you want
to track now when it comes to tracking events on a website you want to identify find those events so we did that by
choosing this donate Now button now once we identify what we want to track we
need to assign two parameters for that event so with event tracking you have
three parameters but one is actually optional so you have two mandate mandatory parameters that you have to
assign to everything you want to track on your website and that's the category and then the action so event label or
label is the third parameter but again that's optional okay so basically when
we identify an event on our website we want to assign it a category and an
action okay so why do we want to assign it a category in an action because when
we're in analytics under Behavior under events top events we could see we have
different categories here and we have different actions we have different labels so if I click on any one of these
Dimensions I'm going to be able to see sum of the parameters I've entered in for previous events I'm tracking okay so
the whole idea is you want to be able to group different events together into a
category and assign an action and assign a label to it that's really what you're doing you're just grouping and
identifying the events you're trying to track and so in this case I have this
donate Now button sitting in the header okay in fact I have a lot of things sitting in the header so if I wanted to
and I want to track all these buttons I can create a category called header and then if I track all these buttons all
these buttons can sit in that same category if I wanted to or I can create a separate category for each of these
buttons it's up to you how you organize your categories because basically all
you're doing is giving a name to what you're trying to track and the name is equivalent to a category so in this case
the Donate Now button is very important I'm just going to call it category header donate now I need to give an
action to each category and so in this case I'm just going to say click because
that's what the action is doing it's it's somebody's taking the action of clicking now if it's a video and it's a
play button I can assign an action of play it's up to you whatever you name
these parameters you just need to be organized and methodical about what you name it that's all and so in this case
header donate and then click okay and so that's our category in action and so
that's clearly step two so step one identify what you want to track step two
assign a category action and or label but remember label is optional so if we
go back in analytics here I could see some categories and if I click on action I can see some actions that I've named
now step three so we've identified in Step One what we want to track we've
assigned a category in action so step three is going into Google tag manager
to set up the event okay so if you're not familiar with Google tag manager
then you can easily just you know do a Google search for Google tag manager and
basically you'll have all sorts of information on it there's a good video overview of tag manager here that you
can watch so tag manager basically is what we want to use to set up event
track and now tag managers use for a lot of different things but the main thing we're doing here is setting up an event
for our website and so I'm logged in to the same email address I'm using for
analytics okay so now I'm in tag manager and I want to set up my event for this
donate Now button so what do I need to do well for every event I want to set up
I need to set up a tag okay so if I go to tags I can see I already have some
tags set up up and some of these are events and so when you actually set up a
tag I recommend having a naming convention so here you can see any event we set up we start out by calling it GA
Dash event Dash whatever it is we're trying to set up and so in this case we want to set up a new tag for the Donate
Now button on our website so we're in Google tag manager because tag manager is what's going to fire that event so if
I click on new okay and I click on tag configuration I'm going to choose Google
analytics and then I'm going to choose event as my track type so we want the
data to show up in Google analytics and we're tracking an event we're not tracking a page view we're tracking an
event and so now remember in step two you identified what you want to call
that category you identify what you want to call that action and you have some optional parameters like label so first
things first header donates the name of our category story and our action is
click and if you want to add in a label and a value so if you want to sign a
value you can if you want to add in a label you can okay those are optional so
you just need to focus on category in action and then the last setting here that's probably worth mentioning is a
non-interaction hit okay so this is automatically set to false and why is it
set to false because it's a non-interaction no that's false we want this event if somebody clicks on the
header donate to be an interaction so for example if I land on this page here
and I click on that donate Now button that I'm tracking as an event and I
actually leave the site because I have my settings set to false I want that
click to be an interaction then analytics is not going to count a bounce if I change it to true so from false to
true then that means it is going to be an non-interaction if somebody lands on the
page and if somebody clicks on the button so I don't want it to be a bounce I want it to be an interaction so my
advice is leave it set to false we're going to choose Google analytics as our
setting here this is our variable for Google analytics so in other words that variable is set to our analytics
property ID and more or less that's what you need to do to set up the tag okay
you need to in step two identify the category in action and or label and or
value now value can be anything you want you're assigning a numerical value so if
you just assign one anytime that event fires in analytics it's going to have a
value of one okay and so we have our non-interaction set to fall so anytime the event fires it's going to count as
an interaction and therefore not count as a bounce if somebody landed on that
page so that's more or less all you need to do to set up the tag and Google tag
manager now if somebody else is setting up the tag for you then again you want to revert to step two you want to be
able to give that person the appropriate category action and or label and or
value why because you're the one that's going to be going into Google analytics and you're the one that's going to have
to go to behavior events top events and look for the particular at category in
action and or label so you need to be able to communicate that information to whomever is setting up the tag now if
it's you great you already know what it is because you're entering that information into tag manager so in this
case I'm going to go ahead and choose a variable for my label parameter and why
do I want to do that because in tag manager I have something at my disposal
called variables and variables allow you to see specifically things that are
being tracked so in this case I chose page path okay so pagepath is a URL and
why did I choose pagepath as my variable for the parameter label because if
somebody does click on the header donate button and the header donate button on
our website is on every page so if I go to the children's page I'm still going to see that header donate button and so
for me I want to be able to see what page somebody clicked on that hitter
donate button and so this allows me to actually see in Google analytics what
page somebody clicked on the header donate Now button and so now if I go back to GTM Google tag manager I have a
category I have an action and I have a label which is a variable okay so note that in Google tag manager you have a
lot of different variables at your disposal and variables are there to help help you identify specifically what is
being tracked so take a look at all the variables at your disposal and tag manager in this example I'm using page
path so now once you set up your tag pretty straightforward again tag types
Google analytics track type is event you are assigning the category action and or
label and or value you're changing or leaving the default in place for
non-interaction hit and then you're choosing the variable for Google analytics which is your property ID so
once you've done that you have a tag the second part of setting up a tag is to assign a trigger to that tag so tag
manager needs to be able to know when to fire that event and so here I'm going to
look at a trigger I've already set up for this particular event and so if I
click on it I'll be able to see that what it is is a click on some links not
all links but some links I'm actually saying Hey Google tag manager fire this
event when the click ID equals header donate button now it just so happens
that if somebody did click on this donate Now button they're gonna go to
another website in this case networkforgood.com so in tag manager I
could have set the trigger to equal URL equal instead of Click ID I could have
said URL equal networkforgood.com so that could have
been my Logic for my trigger in this case I decided to go with the click ID
and so in this case that button has an ID associated with it called header
donate button so if you wanted to use click ID for your event for your button
you could simply just go to the website you can right click on that button and
click inspect element and so when I actually inspect the element I can see now the button here you can see it's
highlighted in the upper Pane and in the lower pane I can see where it's linking to it's linking to networkforgood.com
but here you can see if I hone in a little and I could see ID equals header
Dash donate dash button so that's the click ID notice there's also a class I
could have set the trigger to equal this class or again I could have set the
trigger to equal the URL or the page that this button is pointing to I could
have chosen any one of those but I decided to go with the ID so this is the ID I chose and that's the ID I have in
my trigger okay so that is what's going to fire that event so if somebody clicks
on a button that equals header Dash donate dash button it's going to to fire
that event which is going to equal category header donate action click and
then the label is going to be page path so now that we've set up our event we
want to test to see if it actually works so there's two ways to go about testing an event and the first way is through
Google analytics so if we go to Google analytics and then we go to real time okay we can go to events and here you
can see one is already fired so let's go ahead and go to and test this and go to
the website so if I go here for example and I click on amagar alumni okay so if
I click on that you can see I'm under our family and if I click on that button
then go back to analytics and look at real time I should be able to see this
event fire so if I click on it I'm going to go to network for good now if I go back to analytics here in real time
under real time under events per second I can see that event firing category
equals header donate the action equals click now if I click on the category
here I can see the label the label remember was page path and here you can
see this event fired on the our family page which was the page I was just on so
that's one way to test to see if your event works and in this case analytics
recognize the event so it works it fired and so therefore it's going to show up
under Behavior under events you can go under overview or top events okay and
what am I going to look for in this case I'm going to look for header donate okay if I click on header donate as my
category I'm going to be able to see my action and if I click on action I'll be able to see my label in this case home
page and then later on when the data propagates in analytics I'll be be able to see under label the page that I
clicked on that header donate button which is slash our family okay the second way in which you can test to see
if an event fires is if you preview so if I click on preview in tag manager
okay I'm going to go into preview mode okay in preview mode allows you to see in analytics and tag manager and on the
website what tags are firing so here I could see I'm in preview mode now so I'm
going to go to the website and I'm going to refresh and in my browser same
browser I'm using for tag manager I can see the tags that are being fired on
this page already okay because I'm in preview mode so here I could see remarketing I could see page views I
could see Google optimize I could see some tags that are already firing on this page now if I click on this button
here by holding down my shift command and then click on that button I'll be able to see that the tag fired in preview mode there's my event header donate and I can see it fired so now I
can see it fired in the preview mode so in addition to Google analytics in
preview mode I could see that that tag is fired and I know that it's working so
there you have you have two ways to test to see if the event fires again you have
real time and analytics okay so in real time if you just go up to real time all
you need to do is go down to events go to your website click on the button if
you see it firing in real time then you know it works the second version or second way to test your event is through
the preview mode okay if you see it firing in preview mode then you know it's also working okay so let's rehash
our steps first step is we want to be able to identify what we want to track
okay so it could be this newsletter sign up it could be click on a Facebook it could be anything we want to be able to
track an image a click on a CTA button whatever we want to track identify it
second step identify the category action and label because that's what's going to
show up in Google analytics remember label is optional variable or excuse me
value is optional third step go into tag manager actually set up your tag and
your trigger so if you set up a tag and it's an event name it GA Dash events
that way you can see in your list of tags and tag manager what event tracking
you have already set up so when you set up your tag you set up your trigger your trigger is based on logic that can be a
URL it can be a click ID it can be a class ID whatever you want to use to
fire that event and then once you do that you you want to test it you could test it in GTM or you could test it in
Google analytics if it doesn't fire you want to tweak your trigger if it does
fire then great and then one thing I would recommend is if you're setting up
various events for your website as a best practice what I would recommend is
set up a spreadsheet and in that spreadsheet you know you want to put a note what's firing what are you doing to
fire it could be in this case someone somebody clicks on the Donate Now button in the header you want to put the tag
name in here the type okay then you want to record your category action and label
and then the great thing about events is you could turn those events into goals
and that's as simple as going back into analytics okay so if I go into analytics
and I go to admin and I go to goals if you set up a new goal okay all you need
to do is choose custom click continue you're going to choose event as your
goal name and then from a naming perspective in Google analytics for your
goal I would definitely put event first and then click on header donate okay so
if I click now continue what is my category it's equal to header donate my
action is click and so I can verify to see if this is working and here I can
see in analytics that the goal would have a 0.22 percent conversion rate so
that tells me that the goal is working and I can turn this event into a goal and when you turn something into a goal
in analytics then you can measure it across all dimensions that's what I
would recommend if the event is equal to a kpi or business goal or it's of
importance something you really want to measure okay if it's just a click say on a Facebook button I wouldn't recommend
setting that up as a goal okay so once you've set up your event you're recorded it in your spreadsheet it's firing you
want to be able to then go back into Behavior back into events okay you can
go to top events okay so top events tell you by category as a default what events
are firing or what category is firing the most okay so if I choose my date range here I can just go to here to date
so here I can see my enter donate button fortunately for me has the most total
events now notice in analytics you also see unique events and so the difference
between unique events and total events is that unique events are equivalent to
one per session where total events means that somebody can come to your website
initiate a session and click on that button multiple times in the same
session so if I go to the alma Foundation website okay I can click on that donate Now button three or four or
five different times in the same session so what analytics is going to do is actually in that session count it once
but accumulate the number of clicks as a total event for that session so you're
always going to have more total events than unique events because in some cases
users May click on the button more than once in the same session and so here I
can see total events unique events and if I added a value to that event I
should be able to see it here so if I added a dollar as an example to this
particular event because it had 164 unique events I should be able to see
164 as my value but since I see Zero that means that I did not assign value
and so average value basically is just giving me how much average I have per
event so it's taking into account the number of or the value the total value 2
divided by the total number of unique Pages or sessions and so because I don't
have value I'm not going to have average value but here you can see because value is optional here I can at least see how
many events or how many clicks I receive for a particular button again it could
be a video if I clicked on this video as an example I can see how many people
actually started it I could see the unique and the total events and if I click on label if I have a label
assigned then I'll be able to see what page triggered that event so if we go
back again to our header donate button back to category if we click on label as
our primary Dimension here we can see the home page had the most unique events
been followed by the children's page the contact form Etc so what you can do in analytics you can also look at the pages
that have driven events so here I could see the home page has accumulate related the most total events followed by the
contact us so that's how you would look at the data in Google analytics under
Behavior under events and then under top events or overview is where you can
start analyzing your event tracking so first you need to do identify it assign
a category action enter label set up that tag and Trigger once you do that
once you test that it's working this is where you're going to go to analyze the data let's start out with why GTM so
let's just say your Sam and you have your own e-commerce website you want to
understand how people are interacting with your website well Sam today's world
of websites contain a lot of interactivity everything from videos to
PDF downloads to commenting to form submissions uh to all sorts of chat
Google Tag Manager
functionality interactivity going on throughout the website so there's just a lot that you need to track outside of
just page views and so really what GTM does is they help you track all these
things I just mentioned everything from somebody clicking on the play button of a PDF to somebody clicking on the submit
button of a form to somebody entering in something on a chat function so that's
what GTM is so why GTM because it helps us track all that interactivity so all
GTM is is really allows you to really place a piece of java code which is just
script and this script that's added to a web page to collect information so
that's really what a tag is it's just some script that gets put on a web page in order for you to collect information
like page views clicks Etc and they send it to third-party tools okay so that's
what GTM does it basically allows you to take all these tags that collect
information and you can use them in GTM so if you want to for example collect
how many people you know enter a chat functionality and start chatting well
you're going to take that script and you're going to put it in GTM and GTM will then allow you to start tracking
that information so that's really what GTM is it just allows you to put tags into a container or think of it as a toy
box you have all these toys and you want to track well you can put all those those toys or tags in a toy box or
container we're going to talk a little bit more about that but before we get into GTM let's just say you know you're
communicating with your developer and there's a new user request on your web page and you want to update the tag well
your developer considering it's probably a small update your website is probably
gonna not hesitate Tate and is going to go ahead and turn around and do it normally and so normally what happens is
the developer is going to go to the website and update the tag well what if you have a few things that you want to
track all those things I mentioned before from downloads to clicks to you know somebody checking out to watching a
video well your Web Master your web developer is going to go well hold on a second now all these requests are going
to take time I need to put them into the work queue so to speak well what happens
is when they go into work queue usually it's going to take some time and in some
cases you as a marketer need to launch a campaign and you want to get that
tracking added to the website in time for the campaign launch so you want to go ahead and quickly turn around the
tracking for that particular campaign let's just say you're launching a campaign and you're sending people to a
landing page that has a form submission and you want to be able to track how many people click on the submit button
of that form submission well if you need to turn that around your developer's like well I need to put that in a work queue the timing isn't going to always
work out between you and your developer is my point and so that's where GTM comes in because there is a solution to
update your tags faster and that's Google tag manager so when we say GTM
that's what GTM stands for Google tag manager it's a place for you to add tags quickly and easily so tags remember are
just Snippets of code that allow you to track things on your website interactively interactive actively and
basically when you have GTM you can bypass the webmaster and do it quickly
and easily so that's what GTM is all about so why GTM because we just
identified two benefits one you could track all the interactivity on your website and two you can bypass your web
developer or webmaster and so that's the benefit of GTM so the benefit you get
those tags updated very quickly via Google tag manager okay so that's what
tag manager is so what we're going to talk about today is specifically what
tag manager is and what it does we're going to list some of the benefits of tag manager we're going to show you how
it works and then we're going to show you how to get started with tag manager tag manager if you're not familiar with
working with webmasters and dealing with JavaScript and tags and all this jargon
is just new to you today okay well don't fret sit back we're gonna take it slow
this is an introduction into Google tag manager again let's start out with what is tag manager so we've already
introduced it to some degree because we already introduced as a tool where you
can put all your tags into a toolbox toy box or container so to speak right and
we already already mentioned that hey you can bypass your webmaster so you're probably thinking well if I'm if you're not familiar with tag manager how can I
bypass my webmaster well first about to free tool and it's a Google tool hence
the name Google tag manager and it helps you really that's the main point it's deploy and track tags on your website
bypassing your webmaster so that's tag manager and so examples of tags that can
be deployed via Google tag manager are numerous these are just some examples
like Google analytics Facebook's pixel tracking or Google ads There's No Limit
into the number of texts you can track and tag manager there is no limit you
can add any number of tracking tags and tag manager okay so some of the benefits
well again I we just listed two you can put any tag into tag manager and track
that onto your website and we know you can bypass your web developer or webmaster and what it also does is it
also allows you to test and deploy your JavaScript codes quicker so remember
these JavaScript codes or Snippets of codes are are just there to track
certain things on your website whether that be a page view or somebody clicking on a play button or tracking somebody
who converts or even just goes to your website so the biggest benefit is you can take that snippety code let's just
say Facebook let's just say you're growing Facebook marketing and you want to put that Facebook pixel on your
website so that you could track people who come from Facebook and convert well you don't need to put that Facebook
pixel on your website you can go right to tag manager and you can put that snippet of code right in tag manager
really quickly and the other benefit here is all tags are managed in one
place and that's that to me is really a good benefit because when you start adding tags on your website and you have
some tags and tag manager it just gets very confusing so ideally all the
tracking codes you have on your website needs to be in tag manager think about that all the tracking so if you're doing
Bing or you're doing Facebook or you're doing Twitter or you're doing LinkedIn and you're doing Google you're doing all
this type of marketing on all these different platforms you're going to have tracking code for all these different
platforms and instead of putting all that code on your website return gonna slow down the load time of your web page
and website you want to put them all in tag manager so they can be organized and you know exactly what you're trying to
track and the other great benefit of tag manager is there's a versioning control so let's just say you have added tags to
your website via GTM for the last six months well and let's just say you add
another tag yesterday if you added that tag yesterday and something doesn't work well you can just roll back to a
previous version It's that simple so you have versioning and that's that's a good thing when you have versioning you can
control what gets published and if something doesn't work after it gets published then you can roll back to a
previous version so it's a a peace of mind so to speak just because you've added code to your site there's no
guarantee it's going to work and so you can always control what version you're dealing with in tag manager and we'll
talk a little bit more about that so the biggest benefit here to me with tag manager is you have event tracking and
so we talked about some of the things you could track on your website from videos from play buttons to somebody
clicking on the stop on the video or pausing it all the way to somebody again
chatting or let's just say somebody clicking on that purchase button on your
website okay and you want to track all these different things these different interactivities and buttons well event
tracking is what you're going to use to track all those buttons and to me this is the biggest benefit of tag manager
and I'll show you some examples as we go along and if we didn't mention it already I'll mention it again it is free
tag manager is free there's no limit so once you have tag manager going you can add as many tracking codes as you want
there's no limit on the number of tracking codes you can add to tag manager okay so it's it's free and you
can use it to its fullest Advantage okay so it's also high security meaning that it has different levels of permissions
okay so you can have uh somebody just go in and look at the different tags and
tracking codes you have in GTM or you can ask somebody who is very familiar with tag manager it can go in and add
the tracking code to tag manager and then publish that tracking code when it gets added so those are all the benefits
let's talk about how it works now specifically how does tag Manager work because you're like Rob okay again a lot
of jargon you know you you got tags and JavaScript and and versioning and
Publishing and all this other stuff well I know I'm throwing a lot at you at once but just bear with me here okay so let's
start talking about how it actually works so you have a website okay
whatever that domain is you have a website and there's chances are on your website you have some form of
interactivity whether that be a video whether that be a Blog whether it be a form submission you have a website with
some interactivity and let's just say you're even thinking about getting ready to launch some type of campaign on maybe
Google or Facebook and you want to drive traffic to your website fair enough you're joining the millions of other
websites that are out there that have interactivity that also Drive traffic to the website so incomes Google tag
manager and so tag manager is important because again we know we want to track people coming from that Facebook
campaign or that Google campaign and interacting with our site so if you are running Facebook and you are running
Google analytics well guess what you want to put that tracking code in tag
manager so Google analytics being a Google product works very nicely with tag manager Facebook has its own
tracking code but you still want to be able to track people who come from the Facebook campaign to your website so
you're gonna get that tracking code from Facebook and put it in tag manager that's generally how it works so so pair
information from your website is shared with another data source through tag manager so think about that if I add
Facebook tracking code to tag manager or let's just say a Google analytics tracking code to tag manager tag manager
is the one that's pushing out and doing all the heavy lifting they're the ones that are controlling what code gets
fired and what code doesn't so if you're putting the code in tag manager tag managers controlling the code think
about it that way and let's show you an example of what that looks like so here I am I'm in tag manager I just went to
tag manager.google.com and here I can see a list of tags so in our conversation
we're talking about tracking Facebook and we're talking about tracking Google analytics well Google analytics is easy
because it's a Google product so here if I look at all the different tracking code I have on my website through tag
manager let's just take a look at Google analytics so if you're going to use Tag manager you might as well put the Google
and analytics code in here so here I can see I have Google analytics as a tag in
tag manager now for Facebook if I'm running a Facebook campaign well I can
take that pixel tracking and put it in GTM as well and here I could see Facebook pixel that is that code is
added to GTM I just basically took what Facebook gave me and put it in a Google
tag manager so you can see I can add Facebook and Google analytics and again
I can't stress it enough any tracking code from any platform I can add to
Google tag manager in order to track the behavior from those sources so let's take a little bit deeper dive into how
tag manager works so I just showed you an example of how you could take Facebook and Google analytics code and
put it in the tag manager but if you're not familiar with tag manager then how do I do that well let's talk about the
structure and how tag manager works so when you have a tag man your account you have a container remember I mentioned
Toy Box earlier you have a bunch of toys if they're they're code and you're
tracking different bits of code from different platforms like Facebook think of those as toys and you have a toy box
okay well that's what this code is and that's what a container is the code is the code and that's going to go into the
toy box or container and so the way tag manager works is you have tags triggers
and variables so if I take my Facebook tracking code and put it into a container I need to set up a tag and a
trigger okay so let's take a look at what that is so first if I go back to tag manager I'm going to have an account
and if I have an account I'm going to have a container so here I'm just going to click on an account with a container
and a container is nothing more than what website you're adding the tracking code to okay that's all the container is
we're just letting tag manager know this is the website we're adding all this code too so you have tags triggers and
variables that's the structure of tag manager so tags are just what it says
tags what are we trying to quote unquote tag well if it's Google analytics that's
easy here I could see I have Google analytics added so if I click on Google
analytics here's my tag and if I take a little bit of a deeper dive there since
Google analytics is a Google product it integrates already with tag managers
it's pretty easy I can just choose Google analytics then I'm going to check page view and that's my tag now every
tag needs a trigger okay so I need to tell tag manager how or when to fire the
Google analytics tracking code so in this case I'm going to tell tag manager to fire on all pages so if I get
somebody a visitor to my website analytics is firing on all pages so whatever change that visitor lands on
Google analytics is gonna fire so that's really what it comes down to is I have a
tag and I need to tell tag manager when to trigger that tag that's really what
the structure of tag manager is it's tags triggers and variables and
variables we're going to talk about here in a couple minutes but do you have a piece of code you're going to go ahead
and put that into tag manager you're going to tag it and then you're going to fire that trigger so let's take a look
at another example here if I go back here you can see Facebook well here's my
Facebook pixel okay that's my tag so when is it gonna fire well it's gonna fire on a specific domain or subdomain
that's basically what we're doing we're trying to tell GTM when to fire that
particular tag so those are the three main components a tag okay which is
going to contain the JavaScript code that you get from say Facebook the
trigger so you're going to go into tag manager and tell tag manager want to fire that code that's the trigger and
then you have variables and so variables are basically just additional
information that tag manager may need for your tag and Trigger to work so
that's what a variable is it's there to get the tag and Trigger to fire so variables are divided into built-in and
user-defined variables so common used variables include say page path or page
URL or hostname or click class again they're there and these examples I just
gave you are there to get your tag and Trigger to work think about it that way they're just that's a component and if I
go into tag manager here and here on the left side I can see variables so
remember I have built-in and user defined so built-in means that tag
manager already built these for me so in case I need to get my trigger here to
work with my tag I can use a variable so those are built in and then I have user
defined so these are what I Define these are what I created and again the variables are there to get the tag and
Trigger to work okay so that's the job of the variable the job of the tag is to
host that JavaScript code okay in the case of Facebook or analytics that's
where we're putting our code so here if I click on AdWords remarketing again it's a Google product so I don't really
need to even deal with code I'm just going to select Google AdWords for marketing okay so you can see GTM
integrates nicely with some of the other Google products but let's just say you
have a Facebook pixel tracking code you're going to choose custom and you're going to put the code here so that's
part of the tag and then the trigger again is there to get the tag to fire so you're telling GTM when to fire the tag
and the variable is there to help you make sure that that trigger and that tag
work together so that's how all three kind of work together you need the tag to put the code you need the trigger to
tell GTM when to fire the tag and code and the variables there to help you define when that tag and Trigger should
work or how it should work so again review tags are they're just small codes of JavaScript are tracking pixels on
your website and so tags are allowed to manage events like scroll track and remarketing clicks downloads files play
buttons you name it even clicks on external links for example let's just say you have a click uh or a Facebook uh
icon on your site and when somebody clicks on it they go to Facebook you want to maybe track that you're going to
create a tag okay the trigger is there because you need to tell GTM when to
fire that tag so it's a certain condition whether it's you know fire the tag if the URL equals facebook.com or
some other condition so the tag cannot be created until the creation of the
corresponding trigger so tags and triggers go together you can't just create a tag and not have a trigger
otherwise your tag will never fire and then the variable is there again it stores the information when defining a
trigger or transferring data to tag so a variable has a variety of data okay so
you pick and choose the variable you want to use with that trigger okay so you're making sure that by defining a
variable you're making sure that you're telling GTM how that trigger should be
fired so let's take a look at another example here of how all three play together if I'm in this account I'm in
this container if I look down here I can see Google optimize that's another Google product so what I'm doing here is
I just chose Google optimize as my tag it's already integrated so what does
that mean I don't even need to deal with any code I'm just going to select optimize well we have the tag Google
optimize but we need to tell GTM how to fire that and so here we're going to
tell GTM to fire it on all pages so that's basically a very simple example
because we're firing it on all pages so if I want to look at something specific again Facebook here's my tag here's my
code what's my trigger well my trigger is it's going to fire on specific Pages
how do I know that well if I look at the trigger here I could see the trigger is
a page view but I'm telling it to fire on this particular hostname so the tag
and Trigger go hand in hand
so how to get started with tag manager so first things first you have to create
that account so you're going to go to tagmanager.google.com or you can do a
search for Google tag manager and you're going to create your account and then when you create your account what's
going to happen is you're going to set up a container and when you set up a
container you have choices so you could set it up for your website for an app on
iOS or maybe Android or you can even set it up for amp except an accelerated
mobile page so most people by default are probably going to set up tag manager
for their website and so when you do that when you actually select website what's gonna happen is you're going to
get some Google tag manager code in return and so the whole idea here is
you're going to do a swap what's your doing is basically you're saying Okay Google I'm going to take this Google tag
manager code and I'm going to put it on my website I'm going to put it on every page in my website so notice tag manager
has two scripts one goes in the head as high as possible the other goes into the
body tag as high as possible and so what you're doing is you're making a deal you're putting this tag manager code on
your website and in return every code you deal with whether that be Facebook or analytics or optimize or remarketing
or whatever it is is gonna go in GTM okay it's going to go into the Container you created so you need the tag manager
code on your website in order for tag manager to work okay so when you add
this code to your website then you're free to start adding all sorts of tags
to your container but if you don't have this tracking code on your website then none of the tags you add to your
container are gonna work so that's the idea yeah behind the container and then one thing I wanted to mention on the
account is it's a Google account so when you create your account then make sure it's the same account you use with say
Google analytics or some other Google product that's a good best practice is always use the same email address when
you set up your account so that it integrates nicely across all the different platforms meaning you can go
from say Google analytics right to Google tag manager in one browser without having to log out or log in okay
so when you create the account you're going to create your container if you choose web then you're going to be asked
to place code on your website and when you place that code on your website then you are free to start using tag manager
and that means you're free to start adding tags so if you want to know more information about installing Google tag
manager then what I would recommend is visit the quick start guide website of GTM so again if you're curious as to
where that code code is located in Google tag manager well when you create an account and you create a container
that container is going to have a specific ID so if I click on that specific ID here's where I can get my
code okay so again when I'm logged in to tag manager I'm going to click on
workspace but in the top navigation I'm going to see my unique GTM ID if I click
on that that's where my code is going to be located and so again your code needs to go in the header and there's another
script that needs to go in the body and if you're not sure how to add the code to your website well you can always
click on the quick start guide here okay and that'll take you to a quick start
guide page a reference page related to Google tag manager so let's talk about
creating a tag so once you get tag manager installed I'm sure you're
excited to get going and create that first tag so let's talk about how to
create a tag and tag manager so when you're in tag manager all you need to do
is basically you're looking at all your tags if you click on tag in the left side navigation you'll see all your tags
and there's a new button there so you just click new and so basically what you're going to do is you're going to
create your first tag and so what I would recommend once you get tag manager installed on your website I would
recommend setting the first tag up as Google analytics so that will get you
going with tracking page views on your website when some when somebody visits
your website okay so ideally that's what you want to do you want to get Google analytics as your first tag and tag
manager so what I'm going to do is because analytics is a Google product it's already integrated nicely with tag
manager so I'm just going to click on Google analytics it's going to be a page view that's what I'm tracking and now I
have to set up a variable and so what it's going to do it's going to ask me to
set a select a variable and so what you're going to do is you're going to select new variable and what you're
going to do is you're actually going to go and add your tracking ID here that's going to be your variable so where do I
get my tracking ID and analytics well if I'm in analytics I'm going to go to admin and then under property settings
I'm going to see my tracking ID and all you need to do then is go to tag manager and paste copy first you get a copy over
that tracking ID then you're going to get a tag manager and paste it and then that's going to create a variable for
you and then when you create that variable you're going to see it in the drop down here so I've already created it and basically that's your tag with a
variable then what are you going to do you're going to set up a trigger so see I have some triggers already set up
you're going to see a default trigger already set up for you and that's going to be all pages so ideally what you want
to do is you want to select all pages in order for analytics to fire on all pages
so that's what we're doing we're setting up a trigger we're basically telling tag manager hey if I get a visitor to any
page on my website then I want you to fire Google analytics so that's basically in summary how to set up your
first tag and my recommendation is your first tag should be Google analytics and when you set up analytics you're going
to have to set up a variable for the tracking ID and so you get the tracking ID again from admin property settings
copy and paste that tracking ID over save it you have your variable that
variable is going to be included in with the tag then your trigger is going to be all pages and there you go you have your
first tag you have your first variable you have your first trigger so that's basically what you want to do and once
you've added that tag once you've added that trigger then the only thing you need to do now is basically publish the
tag and so anytime you save a tag you're going to go ahead and submit it so that
way it gets published so again what you're going to do is let's take a step back here you're going to choose new tag
you're going to choose analytics from the drop down menu you're going to choose page view then basically you're
going to add your tracking ID so you can set up the variable and then basically that's what you need to do okay you're
going to add that tracking ID and then voila that's your tag with a variable and then once you've done that then
you're going to click submit so when you click submit you're basically saying Hey
I want this tag to go live now this tag and Trigger and once you've done that
then analytics is ready to go and anytime somebody goes to your website on any page tag manager is going to fire
Google analytics so the great thing here is you have something called Google tag
assistant and that's a an extension that works with Pro and so when you've
actually add a tag manager to your site or you have analytics running in tag manager you can confirm if those tags
are firing properly so let's take a look at how Google tag assistant works okay so if you just do a search for Google
tag assistant you're going to see here that it's basically just an extension that works in Chrome and unfortunately
it only works in Chrome browser it doesn't work in any other browser so go ahead and install that extension into
Chrome and when you do that you're going to see this nice icon here in your browser and now if you go to any website
and I click on Google tag assistant and I click on enable Okay so basically I'm
loading Google tag assistant and now once I refresh the page I can see that
this particular site has Google tag manager installed and not only does it have tag manager installed I can see
that it's also has Google analytics right running I have also Google optimize running and I have Google ads
remarketing tag running and tag manager so that's what tag assistant does it allows you to see if one tag manager is
on the site and if it is great what other tags are firing on this particular
site so tag assistance telling me I have these particular tags firing on that
site and they're firing within tag manager so tag assistant is a great way to confirm if one tag manager is on the
site and two what other tags are firing on the site now another way you could confirm if tag manager is firing on the
site is you can go into preview mode so even before you submit and publish your
tag and Trigger you can click on the preview mode so if I click preview in tag manager so basically that's going to
put me in preview mode and so what does that mean well that means that now I'm
free to go to my website right and see if those tags are firing and so let's
take a look at what that looks like so if I go to the website and just click refresh then what's going to happen is
tag manager is going to load in preview mode just as you see here okay so that's going to take a second couple seconds to
load up and now what can I see in preview mode I could see that I have GTM
firing but I also have some other tags found on this page remarketing I have
Google analytics I have Google optimize I have some other tags firing as well
and so the preview mode shows me what tags are firing on any given page and I
can also see what tags did not fire okay so here I have a number of tags already in GTM but they didn't fire on this
particular page so let's just say I clicked on the Donate Now button I'm still in preview mode so I'm going to be
able to see what tags fired now I could see I have a couple attacks bags that
have fired on this particular page and then I could see what tags did not fire on this page okay so that's the preview
mode you can use the preview mode before you even submit a tag and Trigger to see
if it fires and that's the great benefit of tag manager so if you're not sure if something's going to fire or not then
you can always go into preview mode um and if you are sure it's gonna fire then you can go ahead and submit it so you
can leave preview mode and just go ahead and submit that particular tag and Trigger so here I'm going to leave
preview mode and now once I'm done and I'm sure the tag is going to fire and go
ahead and submit all my changes that I've worked on in terms of setting up tags and triggers so that's really GTM
in a nutshell so I have my tags okay my tags are just Snippets of code that I'm
going to put in whether that be Facebook or vet tracking or any other Google
product like optimize answer page view then I have my triggers my triggers are
there to tell GTM when to fire that tag and the variables are there to help
those tags and triggers work together so remember that particular variable we set up for Google analytics okay so here it
is right here because we want to tell GTM what property to specifically fire
in Google analytics so that's why we set up that variable but there are all sorts of variables Google tag manager has
built in or variables already created for you or you can specifically Define a
variable so variables are there to help the tags and triggers work together so when you set up a tag you set up a
trigger you use a variable you can always go into preview mode preview it by going to the website seeing if it
fires if it fires then voila you can go ahead and click submit and that will
publish the tag and Trigger and you're good to go that's pretty much how tag manager works and again I can't stress
that there is an unlimited number of tags you can add to tag manager there's
no limit so you got everything from anything from Google to non-google to
event tracking okay to Facebook to anything that you want to track you want to be able to put into tag manager and
again there's versioning that's one of the great benefits of tag manager so if I want to go back to an older version I
can simply do that so here you can see I'm on version 32. that's how tag manager works and I can't stress that
you know tag manager is there to help you track interactivity on the site
because if you have a site that's interactive that has a video that has a download button let's just say you know
you have all sorts of newsletter sign-ons Facebook YouTube buttons on your website just like this website does
and you won't be able to track how many people click on that particular button well you're going to need tag manager
and when you have tag manager you're going to be able to track all of these button clicks and interactivity on your
website with that tag manager it's going to be hard to do that so that's an introduction to tag manager Google
analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google it was launched back in 2005.
it tracks and Reports website traffic from the information through Wikipedia
Google analytics is the most used web analytics Service as per the sources in
April 2022 Google analytics was used by 73 percent of the 10 000 most popular
website across the globe however as per the reports from beltway.com
to crore 81 lakh 52 477 live websites use Google Analytics
so now this is the time to understand what has been changed in Google analytics over the years
if you are new to Google analytics it's even better before moving forward do subscribe to
Simply learn and hit the Bell icon to never miss any updates from Simply learn so what makes Google analytics so
Difference Between Google Analytics And Google Analytics 4
important Google analytics generates various types of reports and helps to track bounce
rates identify the best content of your website record user Behavior flow on
your site and many other metrics thereby allowing you to understand and
build your business strategies thereby growing your business now that you have understood why Google
analytics is essential let's check what we have for you in this
video first we will understand what is Google
analytics for then we will move forward with identifying Google analytics version for
your website next we will have a detailed look at Universal analytics and Google analytics
score we will continue by understanding success stories from Google analytics
for users and finally we will end this session by understanding the future of
Google analytics port so allow me to introduce the next generation of Google Analytics Google
analytics score also known as ga4 initially Google analytics score was
known as app plus web Google analytics 4 is the latest analytics property with
several advantages over the old Google analytics also known as universal
Analytics understanding more clearly Google analytics score can measure and keep
track of website traffic as well as app usage so now you can imagine that Google
analytics score is the One-Stop solution for all your analytics needs if you are
still using Universal analytics we recommend you to get familiar with Google analytics score as well
as this is the new future of analytics we will understand creating and setting
up Google analytics for account in detail in the upcoming videos let's
first identify which Google analytics property is associated with your website
in order to identify which Google analytics property you have login to
your Google analytics account now go to analytics account
and then open properties and apps here you can see properties for your website
now below the properties and apps several properties are listed where
you can see different IDs if the ID starts with UA and ends with a number
then you have a universal analytics property however if ID only has numbers
like here then you have Google analytics for
property we will learn how to switch the universal analytics account to Google
analytics score in the upcoming videos now that you have understood how to
identify Google analytics property let's take a detailed look at the comparison
of universal analytics data and Google analytics for data
the major difference between Universal analytics and Google analytics Port is
the measurement model Universal analytics uses sessions and Page views as the measurement model
whereas Google analytics score uses events and parameters as the measurement
model therefore any hit type from Universal analytics property say a page
view user timing Etc are captured as event in Google analytics for property
let's see the detail comparison of every aspect of universal analytics and Google
analytics port first we go with events
in analytics every measurable action for example page load form completion
Scrolls app installs Etc is measured as event and event has category label and
action in Universal Analytics moreover it has its own head type
in case of Google analytics 4 there is no categorization all the hit types from
Universal analytics are considered as events now let's find the comparison of
universal analytics and Google analytics for in terms of page views
page views is a metric to find that calculates total number of pages viewed
on your website now let's get a better understanding of page views
for instance when user lands on a web page of your site the page loads this is
considered to be a page view now suppose if user reloads the page
Google analytics tracks it as another page view if the user navigates to another page of
your website and returns to the same page this adds another page view to your
site now that you have understood page views let's see how page views differs in
Universal analytics and Google analytics port from Universal analytics page view
are translated to Google analytics for property as page view event
this page view event automatically gets triggered in Google tag manager the next
metric we have is sessions session is a Time duration for which user is active
on your website a universal analytics session May consist of multiple page
views events e-commerce transactions Etc
the session is considered to be ended if the user has 30 minutes of inactivity or
any other event for which session end is triggered in Google analytics 4 session metrics
are tracked from session start event which automatically gets triggered with
the basic interaction on your website however the session duration depends on
the period between the first and the last event now let's check our next
metric which is custom dimension in Universal analytics custom Dimension
add the information to the collected data whereas in Google analytics 4
information is added through the event parameters moving ahead
the next metric we have is content grouping content grouping in Universal analytics
allows to group content into a logical structure after which one can view and
compare metrics by the group name now talking about Google analytics 4 it has
predefined event parameter for Content group this parameter fills the data into
content group moving ahead the next metric we have is client ID
client ID is a unique string generated randomly and acts as a pseudonymous
identifier client ID identifies the browser instance and then it gets stored
in the browser cookies and therefore subsequent visits to the
same site are associated with that user in both Universal analytics and Google
analytics for client ID serves the same purpose that is the client ID is
responsible for providing the identifier now let's move ahead with the next
metric parameters parameters are associated with Google
analytics Port Properties understanding in detail about parameters
parameters are the chunk of information that specifies the user action
for example parameters can be passed to describe the value of the purchase next
we have is user property user properties provide information like
preferred language a geographical location of the users that interact with
your website or app now that we have seen difference between Universal

Top Free SEO Tools
so with keyword research tools you can do your job a lot more efficiently
finding the right relevant keywords I mean that's really key to SEO is finding
keywords that are relevant to your business product or service that you want to rank for so you want to be able
to choose keywords with high search volume and low competition so where do you get those numbers you get those from
certain tools you also want to get forecasts for certain targeted keywords you want to be able to generate a list
of latent semantic indexing type keywords keywords close to the keyword
you're trying to Target you want to be able to select primary and secondary keywords wisely so having a list of
keywords or certain data points will help you do that and you want to be able to identify the keywords that your competitors are also ranking for so good
keyword research tool will help you do all of those things so what are some of the the tools out there well look no
further than some of the free ones that Google offers like Google Trends so Google Trends is a good tool that you
can lean on if so if we look at Google Trends all you need to do is trends.google.com you can type in a
keyword I can look at the volume or interest of that keyword over time here I'm looking at football versus American
football and I could see how it's trending then I could see you know how it Trends in specific regions of say the
United States as my market I can also look at other related queries similar to
football or American football and so Google Trends is a good tool helps you look at the volume helps you look at
what specific regions helped you look at other keywords you know if you want you can simply just do a keyword search or
you can actually just see what's trending just by looking at the latest stories and insights so we could see
International women's day you know started to pick up steam is picking up more steam Etc so it's certain keywords
that tend to Trend well and you can pick up on what those keywords are using Google Trends now you could also use
another Google tool called Google Keyword Planner the only difference is this one's paid you need a Google ads
account so if we go into Google ads hey you'll need to go to tools and you need a Keyword Planner but when you're in
Keyword Planner you can find new keywords so if I type in for example you
know online marketing and click get started what the keyword tool is going to do is give me the data that I need to
do appropriate keyword research it's going to give me my keyword and similar keywords it's going to give me the
average month and volume and the great thing here is I can actually see the trend for that keyword over time just by
clicking on this little bar graph so for digital marketing I could see what the trend is over time I could see what the
competition is I could see you know if I'm going to bid on this keyword I could
see what the bidding range is so more important I could see the volume and I can see the competition here's my volume
for this keyword over the last 12 months on average and here's my competition so
Google's Keyword Planner gives you the necessary information you need to choose
relevant keywords wisely now there are other tools out there that are paid that help you look for Relevant keywords like
semrush or keyword finder that's a freemium tool so there are plenty of tools available to you you know another
tool I use that's not listed here is Moz so if you just type a keyword let's just type in the same keyword like online
marketing for example okay so what Moz is going to do is going to give me some volume it's going to give me some other
keyword suggestions okay it's going to tell me how difficult that keyword is and it's going to tell me who else is
ranking for that keyword so it gives me again all the relative information I need including competitive information
so you can use these two these keyword tools moz's freemium summer paint summer
free there's plenty of tools out there but these are the ones I would recommend for keyword research now let's turn our
attention to technical SEO so so for technical SEO you're going to need to use some tools there's no getting around
that because you want to be able to monitor how your website is performing I mean is it loading slow for example does
it have a lot of uh issues with the website in terms of server-side rendering for example or server response
time what about four fours and redirects so you want to be able to gather a lot
of the technical information that could Aid or prohibit your site from ranking so you want to be able to also you know
look at what the Bots are seeing and how they're viewing your website so if Google goes to crawl your site are they
experiencing you know a slow server response time were they experiencing Pages not found you also want to see if
you have a site map you know what's the site map are these Bots crawling your site or getting the pages from
assignment again you want to be able to lean on some of these tools to help you fix errors that you may encounter like
meta tags or four fours or canonicals so you need a good tool to help you manage
all that and so I'm gonna go back to Maz starting out so if we go back to Moz Moz is a good tool it's an all-in-one it's a
great SEO platform so if I go to Moz and I log into an account I can just go to
site crawl and so what Moz is gonna do it's gonna give me a lot of information about how Moz is bot is seeing my site
okay so if I go to the site crawl I can look at all the particular critical uh
issues that I've experienced so I could see four or four errors okay read a rex related to that I could see Meta
descriptions missing meta descriptions duplicate content so there's a lot of different issues that Moz is detecting
for this particular site and the great thing about Moz and this is why I use Moz as my SEO platform I don't work for
mods I've just used them a long time is if you do have issues then they give you ways to fix it so how to fix it section
so if I see missing description here if I just click on review and get a more
in-depth analysis as to what the issues are here but I can also click on the why
and how to fix okay and they're going to give you some information about how this is impacting SEO and what you could do
to fix the issue they lay out the issues pretty prominently here you can see for all the metadata issues I have I have
you know 142 total metadata issues I have 10 title tag two Longs I have 122
missing meta descriptions so they lay it out nicely here up the top so you can kind of get a sense of what to work on
and again they prioritize it based on the severity of the issue and then they break it down into several categories
for example I just looked at metadata issues you can see if I click on content issues I have some duplicate content
that Moz is recognizing or missing or valid H tags so Mazda does a really
really great job playing all all the issues out for you to recognize okay there's another tool that I like to use
called screaming from frog it's a pay tool so if we go look here great thing I like about a screaming frog it will
crawl your sight and it will give you some a list of issues just like Mazdas
of you know what it sees in your site is experiencing four fours broken links are
there any redirects it's picking up duplicate content site Maps you know their JavaScript issues how is it see
the site architecture so it really does take a deep look at everything that
could impact your website from ranking okay there are other tools out there like you know deep crawl or woo rank
they're both paid and so pay tools are really great as well it just depends on
you know your pricing structure what your budget is but really when it comes to all these tools they all more or less
overlap and do the same thing you just need to rely on one of them to make sure that you're able to see what the issues
are now there's nothing wrong with using two of them just as a second reference point to see if both are picking up the
same issue and of course I like to use search console I always like to lean on Google search console because that is
the source so search console will also you know give you some feedback on how
Google's bot is crawling your site so that's under the crawl error section here so you can also you know use search
console to upload a sitemap so that's a key to SEO you want Google to be able to
find your web pages quickly so you can simply just signify to Google where your
site map is located so the search console does a lot more gives you some HTML improvements gives you some
backlinking uh and then the process of updating the search console user interface so there's a new user
interface that you can use with Google search console the great thing is it's free and it has everything you need to
know about your website and how it's affected by SEO organic search the only
thing you have to do with search console is verify the site but once you verify it has all the relevant information you
need so let's talk about backlink monitoring and Analysis okay so this is
related to off-page SEO so you're going to need a good tool to help you monitor
your website backlinks and backlinks are simply just links from external sites
pointing to your site and you need to keep an eye on what sites are linking to yours are they spammy related sites are
they good at relevant sites or anything in between so you need to really be able to analyze what the good links are what
the bat links are pointing to your website and you can also you know given the tool also perform some competitor
analysis so you should be able to use a tool to be able to compare how your site's ranking against your competitor
okay you want to measure the ratio referring domains to backlinks so how many pure domains are linking to your
site so you want a tool that's going to be able to tell you that you want to identify and disavow Port back links
okay so you want to be able to to recognize what sites are linking to yours that's actually hurting you from
an SEO standpoint and you want to be able to do something about that okay you want to measure citation flow and Trust
flow you want to check the ratio of Link distribution in terms of is it internal or external or you know what kind of
sites are linking to my site are they you know social related are they pure
content related and then you want to be able to track the number of do follow and no followings you know how many
links pointing to our site are actually telling Google and other Bots not to
follow the link or how many are actually allowing the Bots to follow that link if a bot follows a link it's going to pass
what we call link juice so you're going to get credit for the backlink if it's a no follow you're not going to get credit
for the backlink and we want to be able to measure that and so we want to have tools that will help us do that so what
are some of those tools well hrefs is a good tool it's a pain tool Majestic is a
freemium tool Moz again Moz is the tool I use SCM rush and then again I gotta
mention Google search console so let's take a look at some of these tools in terms of backlink monitoring and
Analysis so let's start with Google search console again it's free you just have to verify your site and so if I go
to Google Search console I can look at links and I can see what external links
I have pointing to my site okay so I could see I have 17 000 in this example
pointing to the home page of this particular site okay so if I click on that I can see all the the top sites
pointing to my home page now from an off-page SEO perspective do you want
every backlink or external link pointing to your home page no so you want links pointing to internal pages so you want
to be able to measure that so I could see with the top linking sites are and I can also see what the anchor text is so
do what I want my anchor text always to be my brand name no I want it to be you
know keyword we're trying to Target search console also gives you some internal links okay what of top link
Pages for internal links so from an SEO perspective you always want to have a nice balance of internal linking so this
report helps you understand what pages are getting links and are the links evenly spread so this is Google search
console this is the links report this is totally free this is provided by Google all you have to do is verify your site
now if we go over to Moz we type in a domain any domain so I just typed in simple and learn okay Moz has some
metrics that are important to off-page SEO including domain Authority so the higher your domain Authority the better
off you are and so what helps a domain Authority grow is how many quality links
are pointing to that domain and so here we could see over 7500 linking domains to Simply learn so
what's important is we just don't want any site we want quality relevant sites
pointed okay so we could see how many total inbound links and then how many ranking keywords we have okay so here is
going to give me kind of an idea of what my domain Authority has been over time they're going to tell me the top
followed links to this site so they can tell me you know what are those links pointing to my site and what's the page
authority of those sites okay here I can get a nice graphical breakdown of the
linking domains by domain Authority so you want pages with high domain
Authority pointing to your site so here I can see 69 linking domains between 91
and 100 so that's really good we want High relevant domains linking to our
site so just like search console I can see the top anchor text being used okay and I can see the top pages that have
you know good page Authority on the side I could see following versus no follow on internal and external links so this
is just the overview so Ma's really really does break down for you you know
what those pages and linking domains are so if I just click on linking domains now I could get a detailed look for my
home page what domains are pointing to our domain so I can see microsoft.com
has a domain authority of 100 YouTube 99 and so not only does Moz provide you
with the domains it also provides you with their domain Authority score and spam score so you want to keep an eye on
any particular site that has a high spam score so having a site with a high spam
score and a low domain Authority will hurt your domain and Page Authority for that page so Mazda does a great job of
breaking it out and this is for any page it doesn't necessarily have to be the home page okay if I take a look look at
another example here Majestic so Majestic again I can use a free version of the tool they have their own metrics
citation flow trust flow so when they say trust flow what's the link quality all about okay citation flow what's the
link volume and they can get an idea of how many external backlinks are pointing to the site and what's the trend end on
that referring domains so Majestic does a really good job again some of the same
metrics that we could see here except they go into detail about languages as well so this is majestic and you got
search console you got a lot of other tools and then I'm going to just revert back to Moz because you want to be able
to compare link profiles if you're in a competitive space and you're doing off-page SEO you know Moz will help you
compare how your site stands against maybe another competitive side or
relevant site so just doing this analysis I can compare my domain Authority spam score how many total
links you know how many external file links or external no follow links a
breakdown of linking domains so it does a nice job of comparing one site versus
another that's going back to Moz and that's what you want you want a good tool that's going to help you do that I
mean there's other tools out there not listed like bright Edge that will also help you compare linking profile so at
the end of the day if you're doing off-page SEO you want to get a sense of what sites are linking to yours are they
quality sites are they spammy what anchor text are they using are they no follow are they do follow you know are
they top domains how do you compare against your competitors I mean all these metrics are related to off-page
SEO so you want a good tool that's going to help you measure this okay so let's talk about rank tracking so when we do
keyword research we're looking for Relevant keywords we find our relevant keywords we sign primary and secondary
keywords to Pages we optimize those pages we do off-page SEO and we do an all this work for SEO okay we want to be
able to measure the fruits of our labor we want to be able to measure how we perform for on and off page SEO for the
keywords we covet in the pages they're related to and so that's where rank tracking comes into play so we want to
be able to track our website's ranking and not just our website all the pages we've optimized we want to be able to
measure our click rates and Impressions we want to be able to track the ranking for both desktop and mobile for specific
locations and we want to identify top performing gaining and losing keywords
so in other words we want to look at Trends is a keyword ranking is it going up and ranking is it going down and
ranking if it's going down in ranking then you need to take action so you need a tool a good tool for rank tracking so
we can look no further than again Google search console it's free it's right from the source so let's take a look at what
Google search console has to offer in terms of rank tracking so if I go to Google Search console and I put in a URL
what it's going to do is it's going to give me and this is the search queries report it's going to give me what
queries people have used to actually type into google.com and it's going to be able to tell me how many times my
pages show Pages showed up for that query it could be more than one page so that's an impression and if I did
receive an depression meaning did my page show up in the organic listing then did I get a click as a result and so in
this case if I got 68 Impressions and 10 clicks for keywords somebody typed in that's a 14.7 percent click through rate
and so with search console we'll also do is say hey look for that particular keyword you appeared on average in
position 4.1 so it gives you really good insight as to you know what people are
typing in and how you're being found for those keywords it breaks it down by Pages it breaks it down by country
breaks it down by device so I could see you know mobile I've had 899 Impressions over the last three
months on mobile and I received 33 clicks as a result my average position on mobile is 2.6 so search console does
a really good job again this is free information uh providing you the actual
keywords somebody's using on Google search as a query and how many Impressions you're receiving for that
keyword how many clicks click click the rate and then average position so in theory the higher you are positioned on
Google the more clicks you're going to receive so if I'm not positioned properly for keyword let's say page two
then I'm probably not going to receive as many clicks as I would like so that's search console there are other tools out
there like hrefs again does a good job of tracking AMZ tracker we look at
wincher so there's some good tools out there I'm just going to show you another one again I'm going to go back to Moz
for example so Moz has a tool called so if I go back into the account so Moz has
a rankings tool that you can look at to see where your keywords are ranking so if you've already chosen keywords and
optimized Pages for those keywords then you want to be able to load those keywords into Moz and so Moz allows you
to do that and so what Moz does they do a crawl once a week and they'll be able
to tell you where you rank for all your keywords are we moving up in the rankings are we moving down how many
keywords do we have ranked between positions one and three eleven through twenty four through ten twenty one through fifty so we'll be able to see
where our keywords Rank and so it gives you a breakdown here of nationally in
the United States where this keyword is ranked and if it's moved up or down and for what URL is it ranked for and so you
can label soak the keywords and and this is what you want to look for in a good tool you want to be able to organize
your keywords and label them so for all our brand keywords we want to be able to label them branded because ideally you
don't want to optimize for your brand keywords so maybe we want to exclude our brand keywords and look at our non-brain
keywords in terms of ranking and so you can certainly add locations and look at specific locations the whole idea
between a good ranking tool is to be able to measure you know if a keyword is
trending up or down okay so I can simply look at a particular keyword and I can see the trend of that keyword and then
you know if a keyword is not ranking then we want to wonder why it's not ranking well is it difficult is it not
ranking because of its difficulty or can we do a better job of optimizing for
that keyword and so Moz also has a page optimization tool so if you're not ranking for keyword you can flip over
the page optimization tool then put in the keyword put in the URL and mods will
give you some idea as to what you can further do to optimize the page okay so that's Moz you know this is hrefs so you
can see ahrefs does the same thing they provide you some visibility average position how much traffic you know where
you're ranking in terms of positions one through three four through ten eleven through fifty and so you want to be able
to get a sense of where my track keywords are trending are they trending up are they trending down and the whole
idea again Beyond a ranking tool is if you're trending down you want to be able to address why it's trending down so you
want to start with on-page SEO can we do a better job of optimizing in or off page does that page need more backlinks
so that's why you need a backlink tool to support your ranking and ahrefs does offer up some competitor information as
well so you can see how your competitors are performing so these are some good examples of ranking tools that you could
take advantage of now there are also a few important SEO tools that can be helpful in different ways for example if
you're doing video so there are some tools to help you measure how you're performing via video for example vid IQ
so let's take a look at vid IQ so if I load in say video in YouTube in this
example how to rank YouTube videos I have a vid IQ extension loaded into my
browser in Chrome and so now I can get a good eye sense of how many views the
duration the engagement rate the like ratio how many people shared it on
Reddit but further I can look at how the video is optimized so they're telling me
the title's too long here maybe shorten it up but we have tags we have descriptions we have cards we have end
screens it's been shared on Facebook it hasn't been shared on Twitter okay it is public we do have pinned comments and we
do have hearted comments and so this gives me an idea of how we did in terms
of optimizing this particular video okay so if we wanted to tweak it we could tweak the title tag make it a little bit
shorter to help it rank better on YouTube so you want to be able to use a tool like this because if you have
videos then you want those videos to rank and so you can certainly watch this video on how to rank your YouTube videos
and in that video we do allude to vid IQ so you want to be able to use a tool
like this because you know YouTube it is a video portal but it's the second largest search engine behind Google so
if you do have videos you want to be able to rank for them and you want a tool that's going to help you measure
and help you understand if you are ranking if you're not ranking why are you not ranking now for Content
optimization there are tools you can use like SCS site checkup or site analyzer
are some good tools if you already have Moz as an example just going back to Moz
as you already know I use mozz a lot so they have a page optimization so you
could check the content and how you're optimized your content so it's going to give me some good feedback on you know
is your page title meta description are they in line okay so it's going to give you some good feedback on that you also
have again I have to allude to search console you can always look at a particular page in search console see if
it has any errors as well so is it duplicated meta description is it a duplicated title tag is it any Pages
missing title tags or meta descriptions so when it comes to content you can look at search console you can lean on Moz or
you can lean on some of these other paid versions like site analyzer when it comes to traffic and metrics look no
further than and Google analytics there is a free version of Google analytics as well as a paid version so if I go into
Google analytics it's going to tell me all of my website Behavior okay who's coming to my site how they got to my
site how they behaved once they went to my site and are they achieving the goals
I set out for them to achieve via conversions and so you want to look at first in Google analytics how much
traffic you're getting so if I go to Google analytics if I go to acquisition all traffic channels I should be able to
see how much traffic organic search is driving over a period of time so I can
see how many users how many sessions then if I click on landing pages I can see what landing page they went to so I
could see the home page over a particular time I had over a thousand sessions I can also see engagement from
organic search are they bouncing how many pages are they looking at in this session after they landed on a
particular page are they staying on the site a long time what's the their duration or are they achieving any goals
so analytics will provide me all that information about how organic search as
a channel is performing the other thing about Google analytics I like and that goes back to the technical aspect of SEO
and that's site speed so if you go to behavior and you go to site speed overview you'll be able to see how my
pages are loading what's the average load time so they'll break it down for you by browser by country and by
specific page so if I look at page timings I'll be able to see what page is
loading slow what page is loading quick compared to site average and so the great thing about analytics is if I have
a page that's loading slow compared to site average they'll actually provide me with some suggestions so if I go to site
speeds and speed suggestions what they're going to do is they're going to have a link in the report that's going
to allow me to click on it and I'm going to be able to see what suggestions they can provide so when this report loads
I'll be able to see what this speed suggestions are for my pages so here I
could see the page I could see what the average load time is of that page so for example this particular page is loading
at six seconds ideally we want to have you know three seconds or under maximum so if I just click on this link here
they're giving me six page speed suggestions so if I click on that I'm gonna go to another Google tool called
page speed insights and then page speed insights is going to run for both mobile and desktop for this particular page and
then this page speed insights report is going to give me feedback as to what I
need to do to speed up the load time of that page so here you can see for desktop and mobile they're going to give
me some suggestions and opportunities so reduce the server response time properly size images serve images in next-gen
formats so all these will shave off time off my page load time and so that's
what's going to help me speed up the page load and that's page being insights you can get to from the speech
suggestions report and analytics so in theory the higher page load time your
chances of ranking on Google organic search diminished so Google wants pages
that have very low page load time that load quickly so Google analytics is
great tool for Speed suggestions it's a great tool for finding out what the traffic is doing on your site how
they're engaging and are they achieving goals now there are other tools out there from an organic perspective like
keyword it that's a good keyword research tool for Reddit so if you go to keyword it you'll be able to see from a
Reddit perspective what keywords are driving volume these are just the results but you can put any keyword in
there and get the results of that keyword with tough competition to rank on the

some companies hiring for significant roles under SEO are Microsoft Disney

SEO Interview Questions And Answers
might be asking interview is differentiate between do follows and no
follows okay so if you take in or listen to my SEO courses on YouTube for SEO we
we talked a lot about do follows and no follows and and simply put I mean do
follows are just signals to the search engines to follow the link so there's a
link on site a pointing to site B we're gonna basically tell Google Bing and
some of these other search engines hey go ahead and follow that link now I know file is just the opposite so no follow
link doesn't allow the search engine crawlers to follow it so if we have a link on our site site a pointing to site
B we could put a nofollow tag in there and what that's going to do it's going to signal to the Crawlers hey don't
follow this link so in the end of the Crawlers don't fall follow the link then there's not going to be any link juice
passed and so Google is not going to give you credit or give that site credit
for having a link pointing to it or pointing to another site or from another
site and so it's all about linking so we can control if there's links on our site
whether we want the Crawlers to recognize those or not simply with no
follow tags so just a reminder link juice is the reputation or Equity pass
from one website to another so if you have a link on another website and that
website is of high quality meaning their page Authority their domain Authority is high they have a lot of content you know
they're not spammy they're really rich and they're relevant then you may want to make sure that the link pointing from
that site to your site is a no follow so that way that Google can recognize the link from that site to your site and
basically that reputation is going to be passed on to you okay so that's a do follow versus a nofollow and why would
we do a no follow well it just pens it really depends a lot of social media
platforms like Facebook have no follows if you have a lot of content you may not want to be pushing out a lot of do
follows it could actually look bad from an external linking standpoint and so a
lot of sites are really particular about who they want to pass link choose onto and give credit for the link so it's a
business decision at the end of the day there's really no hard fast rule here except from an SEO perspective if I have
a site and I have a lot of external links pointing outward to other sites I'm going to be particular about who I
allow the search engines to follow and what links I allow not to follow okay so here's an example of what they look like
so do follow is simply just the href notice the nofollow has the the tag
appended to it the href tag with a nofollow so if the search engine's
crawling your site and they say that no foul there they're not going to follow that link and vice versa if there's a
link on another site pointing to yours and there's a no follow there you're not going to get credit the search engines aren't going to pick up that link okay
so question two what is 301 redirect and how is it different from a 302 redirect
so 301 redirects tell users in the search engine specifically that an
original page has been moved and this is the keyword here permanently so permanently moved we're going to explain
that in a minute so it's just moved from one page to another and so if we don't
have a page anymore we have a new page let's just say you built a new website with new URLs you want to make sure the
old page is pointing to the new page with a 301 redirect so for 301 redirect
is permanent then a 302 is temporary so we want the search engines to recognize
that we have 301 permanent redirects in place why because if we we have
temporary then it might alert Google to not keep that page in its search engine
rankings because it's temporary so why would Google want to keep a temporary page or even a page that is pointing to
another page on a temporary basis so they may remove both pages from its
index okay but if we have something permanent in place Google may say okay this page is permanently linking to
another page or redirecting to another page therefore it's stable it's
permanent we're going to keep that new page in the index and eventually remove the old page so really something
permanent is more stable in the eyes of the search engine something temporary may not be as stable in the eyes of say
Google and if they don't see it as stable then they may remove both pages from the index okay so the idea is we
want to be found in Google search index and we get it sometimes Pages go away for a variety of reasons and if it does
go away just make sure you having a new page for it and that new page is a 301
permanent redirect okay so question three why are backlinks important in SEO
well we kind of hinted on that a bit with the nofollow because if we have a link from another website pointing to
ours and that link from that other website is really relevant and and it
has a high page and domain Authority then it's going to benefit us and so backlinks are important because if we
have backlinks from quite quality sites it's going to improve the credibility of our site especially if it's a do follow
tag so the search engines are going to recognize the relationship between the site that has a link pointing to us okay
so it's just going to build our credibility it's going to increase increase our domain Authority and then
the net effect of that is if we're credible and we have high domain Authority then that's going to increase
the rankings of our pages and when the pages increase in ranking then we're
going to get more of a Lion's Share of the traffic for certain keywords that our pages are found for and if our pages
are found in getting traffic then because we have increased rankings we're likely going to have increased traffic
and then it's just a snowball effect so more traffic leads to more engagement and conversions so the whole idea for
SEO is remember you have an on-page strategy and an off-page strategy building external links is part of an
off-page SEO strategy and we want to make sure that you know we are relevant
in the form of a link or in the form of content on other high quality sites being on a high quality site only
benefits us because again increases their domain Authority Google sees this is more relevant therefore pages are
going to benefit by ranking higher and therefore when we rank higher we get more traffic so it's a snowball effect
so having bad links is important because it snowballs all the way through to
conversions okay so what are the best practices to rank your videos on YouTube
this is a great question really great question given the importance of videos especially with SEO because videos are
found YouTube in itself is a search engine so if we have a video how are we going to get it to rank on YouTube well
first things first you never want to put a video out there and want it to rank if it's not engaging or informative so make
sure you go ahead and follow the best practices of having engaging and
informative content in your video now once you have that video in place you want to optimize it and then some of the
key factors for optimizing a video are you want to choose a title that has high
search volume and low difficulty just as you would keyword for example for web page you want to choose a title with a
keyword in it that has high volume and low difficulty IE low competition okay so you want a nice ratio there and you
know what you want to choose a title that's going to get people to watch the video too so it's not all about just
choosing a title just for the sake of high volume you also have to choose something that's relevant that's going
to be catchy as well and then with that title goes the description so you want a description that's very relevant to your
title okay because most people aren't going to click on a video just for the sake of a title they're going to want to
probably get a sneak peek via the description of what it is so again you want to optimize that description but
make sure the description is is just as snazzy as the title okay you also want to use accurate and relevant video tags
just as you would on Twitter Facebook tag these videos okay so make sure your
title tag length doesn't exceed 100 characters because it will get chopped off so again that goes back to just
writing something really short and to the point that's going to grab somebody's attention Okay you also want
to upload a captivating thumbnail something that's relevant then that's gonna grab somebody's attention and then
again we set it similar to the video tags we want to use relevant hashtags again just as you would with Twitter and
Facebook go ahead and throw some hashtags in there that people could see because people search via hashtagging
and then this goes without saying you did all the work created a really great video it's engaging it's a formative you
optimized it feel free to promote your video on other social media platforms
okay don't just stick with YouTube per se so the benefit here is if you post it
on Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever platform of your choice and it gets engagement people click on the link go
to YouTube they're gonna like it and then other people are gonna see that engagement they're gonna see how many
people liked it or how many subscribers you have so promote your videos to help
you with the ranking of the video on YouTube so that does play into it so go
ahead and promote it so other people can watch it like it comment Etc and then
that's going to engage other people to want to do the same so what is mobile first indexing this is a really
important and timely question mobile first indexing means Google's just using
mobile friendly content for indexing and ranking websites so in other words
Google for example has two Bots they have the traditional desktop bot and
they have a smartphone bot and eventually everybody that has a website is going to be migrated over to the
smartphone bot and so with that smartphone bot goes to your website and starts crawling what do you think they're looking for their smartphone bot
they're looking for mobile friendly content if it's not mobile friendly meaning the page isn't designed for a
smartphone browser or let's just say the images are way too large or you have to
expand the text just to read it you know a lot of these these issues that somebody would have just simply trying
to read something on a web page on their MO mobile device Google's not going to grab that content so you want to make
sure it's mobile friendly so it gets indexed and so if your website has a responsive design Google will rank your
website based on its performance on mobile devices okay so you want to make sure that your website is mobile
friendly and if you're in an interview and somebody asks you this question you could even take it a step further and
say look I'm going to measure how friendly my wall my website is for mobile devices and Google search console
because Google search console has a report that will show you what pages on your website are not mobile friendly and
it's not a guarantee but I could tell you if I'm Google and I'm crawling your site with my smartphone Bob and that
page or one of my pages is not mobile friendly I'm probably not going to index it or rank it so you want to leverage
that report in Google search console to see what pages are mobile friendly so
that's a little bonus for you to really impress press the interviewer who asks
you this question because how are you going to know if one of your pages is mobile friendly or not if you don't look at a report so keep an eye on Google
search consoles mobile usability report okay number six list down the most
important local SEO ranking factors okay so organic local ranking is just as
important as anything else in organic search because if you have a local business you want to use the likes of
say Google my business to show up when somebody types in you know looking for a florist or you're looking for a coffee
shop so what you want to do is you want to create a web page for every product and service okay you also want to opt
for your business listings on Google my business and and there are plenty of other local business directories out
there like Yelp for example or Bing even has one so go ahead and also make sure
you have a business listing as well but since Google in the United States has a huge market share you want to start with
Google first you want to update your nap citations on your website maintain
consistency of your nap okay so nap is name address phone number so you want to
make sure that that's current and consistent so if you have a number on your website make sure it's the same
number on Google my business okay you can embed a Google map on your website it could certainly optimize The Meta
tags and content not only on your web pages but within your Google my business directory so you can add your business
to other local directories like I mentioned Yelp and then also just as
important opt for reviews and ratings okay so the more reviews The Hat you have the better off you are okay so I
always say this with the with local search three of the main factors in showing up for local search on say
Google is obviously the keyword the second is the price proximity of where that person is and then third is the
reviews so you can't really control the proximity but you can't control the keyword and you can control the reviews
to some degree so work hard at getting reviews for your business but at the same time you can certainly work in some
keywords let's just say for your product and service pages on your website but also you can translate that over to
Google my business okay so working in those keywords making sure your your
number your address your name they're all consistent and and really just
spreading your the the business out on other directors that's really all these are really key factors for local SEO
okay so question number seven how to avoid duplicate content getting
penalized for duplicate content so for example if you have two different versions of a web page you may result in
a duplicate content issue so it's just SEO 101 you never want to have two two
or more pages with the same content so what do we do well we can avoid this in
having Google penalize us by again setting up a 301 redirect remember three
or ones are permanent we can also use what they call canonical tag and a canonical tag basically alerts the
search engines as to which page is the original okay so if we have an original page we want to point to that page with
a canonical tag and the third option is opt for preferred domain and Google search console okay so if you have
multiple no names make sure you set up a primary one in search console so those
are ways to work around it of this three I would always go with the canonical tags because that's just a tag that's
going to sit on the page it's going to alert Google as to what the original is just in case they get their hands on the
duplicate so all the pages that have the same content are going to have the same canonical tag pointing to one page so
again three ones are permanent you could simply just redirect one to the other if
you end up having duplication or you could just tell the search engines hey this is the original page or you can go
through search console okay number eight what are the tactics to increase a web
page speed okay so what are some of the tactics well when you build a site especially for mobile you want to keep
it as simple as possible and what I mean by simple as possible really I mean hey use a simple website design don't get
overly creative if you will most websites all websites have images you're not going to be able to get around that
but just make sure you optimize your images in other words don't have such a large image size if you don't need
something very large don't have it okay you want to improve server response time and what do we mean by that well your
site's sitting on a server somewhere you can own that server or you can be renting it out from say Amazon web
services or let's just say GoDaddy as your register they also have web hosting
well if you have it on say GoDaddy server you may be sharing that server
with other businesses and at certain times of the day other businesses may get a lot of traffic and suck up a lot
of bandwidth what is that going to do that's going to reduce the server response time for your site and so you
want to make sure you have an idea of you know what server your web page your
website is on and you want to be able to have some control over that because if your server response is slow that's
going to slow down everything else in terms of loading in the browser and that's not going to be good for SEO okay
optimize your code what do you mean by optimally minifying when we see mimifying we mean get rid of some of the
Redundant code if you have CSS you know get rid of chop some of the get rid of the JavaScript you're not using so
that's what we mean by optimizing code reduce redirects okay ideally you just
want to have one redirect in place you don't want to create a daisy chain so to speak of redirecting and redirecting
after that that's Never Gonna bode well and it's going to slow things down as well enable browser caching so if you
enable browser caching basically if somebody comes back to the page they've been on say two days ago they're
probably going to see a cache version of that page and then off for the content delivery Network as well so these are
some of the ways to reduce page speed now if you're curious about the page
speed of your website you can always go to Google's page speed insights tool and
all you have to do is just Google page speed insights or even just something generic like Google page speed and
you're going to get this tool page speed insights and all you need to do is just plug in a URL when you plug in the URL
Google is going to analyze the URL for both mobile and desktop and so here we
could see Google gives a score so we can see the score from low ball and we can see the score for desktop just by
clicking on desktop and so here I can see some of the issues that the site may
be having in terms of page load time for their desktop if I flip over to mobile
you know here I can see some other issues for example they have a server static assets with efficient cash policy
now if you're not sure what the heck that means you can always just click on it and you can see some specifics here
and where you can just always Google it as well uh here you got to reduce the impact of third-party code okay so
that's another thing uh reduce JavaScript execution time so again going
back to a lot of some of the comments we made about coding okay so sometimes too much code or code not functioning as
well as it should we'll tend to slow down the site okay so you can use page
bin insights you can always get a glimpse of how pages are loading simply by also going to for example Google
analytics under Behavior okay you can go to site speed and if you click on
overview okay Google what go Google does is they do a sampling of pages over time
and in this case based on 89 Page views they have an average page load time and
so you can get a sense of how quick specific Pages load or your site overall simply by looking at the site speed
overview report in Google analytics to get a sense of how quick your pages are
loading now there are certain factors that do affect load time so obviously
the way the page is built with the code the images Etc but also the browser each
browser loads differently okay so you want to take a look at it by browser also by country every country has a
different network you can be in the United States and have worse network
service than you do say in you know Ivory Coast in Africa okay so it really
depends on the network you're on so and also the page every page is built differently so you want to get a sense
of what pages are loading quicker and which pages are not you can simply just go to page timings and Google analytics
you get a sense of what pages do not load fast and which ones do and maybe hone in on the pages that aren't loading
fast and address those pages first okay so you have two tools at your disposal one Google analytics and one page speed
insights okay so let's look at question number nine here so when should an
individual Target short tail and long tail keywords okay so remember short
tail are usually one to two keywords very Broad in nature long tail keywords
or maybe three four keywords in a query or maybe an entire sentence those are
considered long tail keywords so usually short tail keywords have higher volume
but also higher competition longer tail keywords usually have lower uh volume
but also lower competition but the great thing about long-term of keywords the conversion rate will tend to be a little
bit higher than say a short tail because it's less vague and more specific so you
can use short tail keywords if you're trying to drive a lot of visitors because those keywords are going to be vague or Broad in nature long tail
keywords are used for targeted Pages such as product pages and articles so if you have a specific product with a long
name you can certainly optimize that page for that product name again the
product name may have low volume but if somebody types in exactly that product name you show up the chance of you them
converting are going to be very high so you don't have to always be that specific at the product name but try and
be as specific as you possibly can in order to get somebody to click on your link in the search engine results and
get them over to your site to convert okay so those are really the big differences short tail very broad very
vague a lot of volume but also a lot of competition but hey if you're ranking for sure short tail keyword you're
probably going to get a lot of traffic the conversion rates may not be as high as something say long tail where hey
maybe you're just honed in on a few set number of products and you're not care
you don't care a lot about the traffic you just care about getting the relevant traffic to your site to convert okay
number 10 what are they Port elements to focus while developing a website so
we're talking in terms of SEO okay so if somebody asks me this question in an interview what am I going to focus on
while developing a website well the answers are right here yes we talked about mobile mobile is so important
because a lot of websites are going to be indexed with Google smartphone bot so
mobile usability is very important so we need to make sure our website is responsive for mobile just some basic
practices when it comes to site architecture navigation we want to have a simple URL structure okay no overly
cumbersome the navigation should simply be clean and neat okay if you have five products okay maybe you have uh in your
navigation you have something called products with all five listed or you have all five products in the main navigation the key is you just want to
make it clean and neat and easy for somebody to find the the rule of thumb is if it's good for the end user
probably gonna be good for Google but if complicated for the end users probably going to be complicated for Google you
always want to create a site map now what is that sitemap a site map is simply just a formatted file with two
that includes all your URLs and assets your images and your videos they're going to be sitting on your server as
well so you want Google or these these Bots to be able to find your pages and
assets and by the way you want to take it a step further and make sure you upload that site map which is sitting in
the root directory meaning domain.com sitemap.xml okay you want to take that
site map and make sure you input that site map location in Google search
console that way Google search console has a one-way ticket to grab the
elements in the sitemap another important element to focus on while developing a website is having a robot's
text file and all the robots text file is it's like a lock I always say to a house so if you lock a door in your
house nobody's going to be able to get in that door so it's all a robots text file is you're telling Google and these
other Bots that are coming across your site what's locked and what's not locked meaning what they have access to what
they don't have access to so you want to be able to make sure you have a robot's text file if you're trying to non-index
specific pages of your website because if you tell Google don't crawl these Pages or this directory they're not
going to get crawled if they don't get crawled they're not going to get indexed so robots text file is an important
element to focus on while you're developing your website and while you're developing your website it could be on a
you know in a directory just called new web website so you probably want to have new website as the directory in the
robots text file and just to let Google know don't go into this directory
because it's my new website I'm not ready to go live yet so you don't want it indexed so there are a lot of reasons
to have robots text files that's the main reason sitemap you want Google to
get these pages and assets quickly okay you want to make sure that your site
architecture navigation is in order you want to make sure your site is mobile friendly and you also want to make sure
you have content on your website that's the key because that's what's going to keep people on the website and engaged
and when I say content I don't necessarily just mean words I also mean videos I also mean images you know
something interactive okay you want to keep people engaged that's the key behind it trust me if if an end user
finds your site engaging Google is likely going to find your site engaging okay so those are good brownie points to
bring up if somebody asks you this question in an interview so just a quick recap here it's important to have a
better site structure so the Bots can easily access into next content okay with a responsive design helps to make
your website mobile friendly and user friendly would also increase the amount of time a user spends on your website
which may improve your site's ranking sitemap is simply just a file that helps search engine Bots to understand the
structure of the website okay how many pages are on your website and where they located along with the videos and images
okay and then the robots text just instructs the search engine Chrome dollars to understand what pages should
not be indexed okay this is simply just a text file and it's added to the root directory again think like a door think
of a lock okay you can tell you can lock whatever doors you want in your house then give it that way.
